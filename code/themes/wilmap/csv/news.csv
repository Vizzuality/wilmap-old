The Federal Aviation Administration is preparing new rules that could make it easier for law enforcement agencies to use drone aircraft in the U.S., raising concerns about privacy at a time when the aircraft are already conducting surveillance missions in some parts of the country.

M. Ryan Calo, director for privacy and robotics at the Stanford Law School's Center for Internet and Society, says widespread use of drones domestically seems inevitable, particularly since they are an efficient and cost-effective alternative to helicopter and airplanes.

In addition to privacy concerns, Calo said, drones also raise safety and security issues, particularly because they can crash and their guidance systems can be hacked. He cited the case of the CIA drone recently lost in Iran. The Christian Science Monitor on Thursday reported a claim by an Iranian engineer that the Iranians were able to exploit a navigational weakness in the drone’s technology to make it land in Iran.

Holder is mentioned in the below BNA article by Tom P. Taylor in which Falzone explains how the government went too far when it revived copyright protections for certain foreign work.
Congress overstepped its bounds in restoring copyrights for foreign works long held in the public domain, including paintings by Picasso and films by Alfred Hitchcock, lawyers told the U.S. Supreme Court Oct. 5 (Golan v. Holder, U.S., No. 10-545, argued 10/5/11).
The lawyers represented a group of conductors, film archivists, and other petitioners who make their living off of works of art lacking copyright protections.
...
Unprotected works exist in the “public domain” and the rights to those works are owned by the public, Anthony T. Falzone, Stanford Law School Center for Internet and Society, Stanford, Calif., explained. Thus, the government went too far when it revived copyright protections for certain foreign works in exchange for securing greater protections for American authors abroad.
...
According to Falzone, Congress's attempt to pluck works from the public domain and restore their copyright protections was a direct violation of the “limited Times” language in the Copyright Clause.
If Congress is allowed to resurrect copyrights in this way, then no real limit exists on the period of protection, Falzone argued. Without an expiration date, “we can never know if we've reached the end or not.”
...
Falzone also zeroed in on the promotion of progress requirement of the Copyright Clause, arguing that the law does nothing to stimulate innovation in the United States. Rather, it inhibits access only to works previously available to the general public, and “reward[s] people who made things long ago,” he said.

White House Deputy Chief Technology Officer Daniel Weitzner said 2011 was a ""huge year"" for the online privacy discussion, at an event hosted late Tuesday by Politico. There were ""two landmark FTC privacy settlements,"" with Google and Facebook, that show the government ""takes seriously consumer rights,"" Weitzner said. Meanwhile the administration's highly-anticipated privacy recommendations are still pending.
Last month Facebook settled with the FTC on allegations that it made deceptive claims about user privacy when it made changes to the framework of its social network in December 2009 (WID Nov 30 p1). And in October the FTC unanimously approved a consent agreement with Google concerning the company's 2010 Buzz social network launch (WID Oct 25 p5). Both companies will now have to implement comprehensive privacy programs, submit to third-party privacy audits for the next 20 years, and pay $16,000 in civil fines for any violations of the agreement.

""The bill would inflict collateral damages on the Internetand be counterproductive to the IP owners they are trying to protect,"" McLaughlin said.

14,"November 14, 2011",,,Scientfic American,"Ryan Calo, CIS Director of Privacy and Robotics, is quoted by John Villasenor of Scientific American on how the widespread use of drones may actually help privacy law through a backlash that he thinks will result in increased privacy protections.
Editor’s note: This is the second of a two-part series on security and privacy during the age of drone warfare. Part one is available here.
Technology, as Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in a 2001 Supreme Court opinion, has the power ""to shrink the realm of guaranteed privacy."" Few other technologies have as much power to do this as drones. Because they can perch hundreds or thousands of meters in the air, drones literally add a new dimension to the ability to eavesdrop. They can see into backyards and into windows that look out onto enclosed spaces not visible from the street. They can monitor wi-fi signals or masquerade as mobile phone base stations, intercepting phone calls before passing them along. Using a network of drones, it would be possible to follow the movements of every vehicle in a city—a capability that would be invaluable to a police department tracking the getaway car in a bank robbery but invasive if used to track a patient driving to a clinic to get treatment for a confidential medical condition.
The growth in nonmilitary use of drones is too recent to have generated a significant body of legal precedents specifically addressing their implications with respect to privacy. But closely related legal cases and evolving legal and societal standards regarding privacy make it clear that the issue will be complex. For example, in 1986 the United States Supreme Court ruled that law enforcement's use of a private plane to view otherwise hidden marijuana plants growing in a California backyard did not constitute a violation of the Fourth Amendment right of freedom from unreasonable search and seizure. The reason? The police observations were made from ""public navigable airspace."" This might be interpreted to suggest that the owners of drones operated in public airspace will enjoy broad latitude to use them for surveillance in the U.S.
...
Regardless of the details of the eventual regulations adopted by the FAA and by analogous agencies in other countries, drones are certain to have a profound impact on privacy for the simple reason that they make it easy and inexpensive to gather massive amounts of information from above. Ryan Calo of the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School has suggested that the widespread use of drones may in fact benefit privacy law by generating a backlash that will result in increased privacy protections. Even if this occurs, however, it is unclear what forms these new privacy protections might take, and how they would be balanced against the many beneficial uses of information that drones can acquire.

16,"October 18, 2011",,,Marketplace,"CIS Director of Privacy and Robotics Ryan Calo was interviewed by Marketplace Tech Report's John Moe to discuss potential changes that may be made to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act.
This week is the 25th anniversary of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. Can a law passed before the birth of the World Wide Web really keep up with the modern world?
A bunch of people are in Washington, D.C., today saying no way. Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) are joined by advocacy groups such as the Center for Democracy and Technology, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union.
...
Signed at a time when Crocodile Dundee was the number one movie in the country, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act deals with the issue of when a law enforcement body can access electronic data. Ryan Calo, who runs the Consumer Privacy Project at Stanford's Center for Internet & Society, says, ""This act is what governs the circumstances under which the government can get data on people's electronic communications like their emails that are being held in companies like Google's Gmail or Facebook. This act really goes to content of your communications and so the idea here is the government would try to get at what you said in an email.""
...
But even if the law is updated and brought up to the world of 2011, what will it be able to do for the technology of 2012? Or 2020? Or 2036? Calo says it's a struggle whether to write these things in strict terms that will be handy today or in vague terms that could give general guidance in the future. ""In the law,"" he says, ""you see again and again this debate between whether we should be using rules which are very concrete and have the benefit of consistency and you know what they apply to, versus standards, which are these more loose or amorphous ideas. And course tech moves so fast, that standards seem to be the order of the day. It's a very difficult problem and it's not easy for legislators or courts to solve it.""

Calo said the law was written prior to the development of technology such as location-tracking cell phones and services that allow people to store information on remote servers.

He said he wishes the government “would have applied the same zeal to secure the information that they are using to prosecute this case.”

A divided U.S. Supreme Court considered Wednesday whether to allow the government to remove millions of creative works by foreign authors from the public domain in an effort to persuade other countries to respect copyrights on American products.+ Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor emerged as vociferous, and at times unyielding, defenders of a federal law giving foreign works copyright protection. But the other justices appeared skeptical. ...
Falzone argued that Congress already set that time of protection at zero for foreign works by previously determining they're ineligible for copyrights - in other words, the copyrights' ""limited time"" of protection under the Constitution had expired.

Those musicians and other long-gone creators made cameo appearances in the marble-and-velvet arena of the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday, as the justices heard oral arguments in a high-stakes copyright case whose outcome will affect much of academe, dictating what materials scholars can use in books and courses without jumping through legal hoops.

For the lead plaintiff, Lawrence Golan, a University of Denver music professor, that step limited his orchestra's ability to perform canonical pieces by composers like Shostakovich, Stravinsky, and Prokofiev. The law he wants to overturn has also hobbled libraries' efforts to digitize and share books, films, and music.

Jimi Hendrix made an appearance at the Supreme Court on Wednesday in an argument over whether Congress acted constitutionally in 1994 by restoring copyright protection to foreign works that had once been in the public domain. The affected works included films by Alfred Hitchcock and Federico Fellini, books by C. S. Lewis and Virginia Woolf, symphonies by Prokofiev and Stravinsky and paintings by Picasso.
The suit challenging the law was brought by orchestra conductors, teachers and film archivists who say they had relied for years on the free availability of such works.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor said there was nothing unusual in granting copyright protection to works that had once been in the public domain. In 1790, she said, Congress ""took a whole body of public works and gave them copyright protection the day they decided to pass the copyright law.""
Anthony T. Falzone, representing the challengers to the law, disputed that as a historical matter saying that ""that was the first copyright act, and Congress established a baseline.""
...
Mr. Falzone questioned that. Congress, he said, ""took speech rights of 250 million Americans and turned them into the private property of foreign authors, all on the bare possibility that might put more money in the pocket of some U.S. authors.""
Near the end of his argument in the case, Golan v. Holder, No. 10-545, Mr. Falzone returned to the chief justice's reference to performers like Hendrix.
""There can't be any doubt, as I think Chief Justice Roberts got at, that the performance has a huge amount of original expression bound up in it,"" Mr. Falzone said.

On Friday, hackers broke into the main Twitter account for NBC News and reported a terrorist attack on Ground Zero. Twitter acted fast, pulling the accounts of NBC and the Script Kiddies, the LulzSec-lookalikes that took credit for the attack, but the tweet stirred some anxiety in the days before the tenth anniversary of 9/11. This is hardly the first time that rogue tweets have stirred fear, and Twitter is drawing an increasing amount of scrutiny for the potential dangers of people using the service to incite violence. There are also new details about how the NBC News account was hacked in the first place (hint: don't click on mysterious files that strange emailers send you). All in all, though, the burgeoning social media company has not always been so quick to address the misinformation. Twitter is a boon for free speech around the world, but considering the security problems, it's also struggling with the consequences of free speech left unchecked.
The NBC News breach could've happened to anyone. MSNBC reports that Ryan Osborne, NBC's director of social media, received some suspicious emails in the days before the attack and, probably out of simple curiosity, opened an attachment that might have infected his computer with a Trojan horse. Once installed, this type of spyware can nab passwords by recording keyboard strokes. With a stolen password from Osborne, the Script Kiddies would have been able to take control of the account and tweet about terrorism or anything else they liked. The F.B.I. is meanwhile investigating the hack, but a government official told MSNBC, ""The truth is it's relatively easy to get into these accounts.""

28,"September 5, 2011",,,The Guardian - Legal Network,"An excerpt from a blog written by Ryan Calo, CIS Director of Privacy and Robotics, is referenced by Sara Mansoori of The Guardian in regards to how the greatest use of drones can be for surveillance.
The military use of ""spy drones"" is very well established. United States Air Force drones have now done more than a million ""combat hours"". Drones have been used by the police in Britain for some time. It is now reported that they are being used for news gathering purposes by News Corporation in the United States.
News Corporation's iPad publication, The Daily has reportedly used its drone to capture aerial footage of Alabama storms and flooding in South Dakota. Their hardware is a MicroDrone md4-1000, a micro aerial vehicle that can be fitted with various imagery or sensor payloads. It appears that such use may be contrary to the Federal Aviation Administration rules which currently govern the use of drones – as they cannot be used for commercial purposes.
...
The use of drones by media corporations obviously gives rise to serious privacy issues. These are discussed in a recent post by Ryan Calo on the US ""Concurring Opinions"" blog. He points out that the greatest use of drones is for surveillance:
""Industrial-grade drones can fly for miles searching for objects of interest or hover at a particular location and report any movement. Not only can they record high-resolution video, but some drones come equipped with thermal-imaging and other sensors capable of seeing what people cannot. There have even been reports of a drone capable of impersonating a cell tower so as to intercept phone conversations"".
...
In his post, which is entitled Will drones save privacy law?"", Ryan Calo seeks to draw out some potential positive outcomes from the ""drone"" phenomenon. He suggests that the difficulty in obtaining public support for privacy law derives in part from an inability to visualise the processes behind modern privacy harm, ""this lack of visceral cues, forms a significant part of the reason that privacy law lags so far behind advancements of technology"". However, he suggests that people may feel very different about drones:
""The introduction of government and private drones into our cities will feel very different to the public and perhaps to the courts. What data there is suggests that Americans are nervous around robots. They may associate drones in particular with violence and the theater of war. The proliferation of drones in our skies could lead to a new, Warren and Brandeis moment—all of our amorphous fears about new technology watching us suddenly reified and immediate.""
As a result, he suggests that drones could end up being good for privacy law with the backlash against their use generating public support for privacy protection. This is an interesting and optimistic thought but, as Calo rightly points out, the increased use of drones appears an inevitability. Regulatory action in relation to both private and public bodies is an urgent requirement.

The other day I received an email from a lawyer in Chicago who I don't talk to very often. So I was a little surprised to hear from him.
There was nothing in the body of the email, but there was an attachment that I proceeded to open.
It didn't take me long to realize that I was not the intended recipient. The attachment was a confidential memo that discussed a possible transaction. Handwritten notes were sprinkled throughout the typed memo, and it was clear from the email's subject line that the lawyer had written the notes.
I sat back in my chair, stunned. I had no doubt that the disclosure to me was inadvertent. Other recipients included lawyers at the firm. A closer look at the email showed it was sent by the lawyer's secretary on his behalf.

Yesterday's 5.9 magnitude earthquake on the East Coast led to a lot of people jumping on cell phones to check in with family and friends. The networks couldn't handle the traffic. And Facebook is making it easier to control what the world sees about you. As unpredictable as the quake was, the collapse of cell coverage was completely predictable. A whole lot of people fired up their phones and hopped on Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile or Sprint, some of them doing so before the ground was even done shaking. But a lot of those calls didn't go through. The system couldn't handle the volume. Spokespeople for AT&T and T-Mobile were quoted in the New York Times as saying that there didn't appear to be any damage to towers but there was just a lot of traffic coming across the networks. ... Ryan Calo is the director of the Consumer Privacy Project at Stanford's Center for Internet and Society. As for the Facebook experience, he says, ""I think it changes it a lot. People are really going to finally get some much better and easier control. One of things I really like, for instance, and this is an old feature, but surfaced -- is the See Profile As feature. Once upon a time you had to log out to see what people could see on your profile. Or you had to click around to find this feature. Now, just on your home page, you can see what your profile looks like to others.

31,"August 24, 2011",,,Smart Planet,"CIS Director of Privacy and Robotics Ryan Calo is quoted in this Smart Planet post about the robot revolution and the hope that robots will make Americans more productive.
We may be poised for the rise of robots after all. Popular sci-fi culture in the 1970s loved tales of robot overlords promising to overtake humans. And we waited for them to come true. Nothing happened. But now, we might just be on the edge of robot revolution.
Smart Planet recently reported on the dropping cost of an open-source robotic platform, meant to greatly increase the amount of robotic research around the world. And many claim the robot revolution will cause just as much upheaval in our lives as did the Internet and the PC over the last three decades. Better technology, falling prices and a new-found surge in open source operating systems set the stage for significant growth within the next decade.
...
Apparently that doesn’t mean Americans will become obsolete, rather the hope is that robots will make Americans more productive, especially in the automotive industries. This is according to Ryan Calo, director of privacy and robotics at the Stanford Center for Internet & Society, who was recently interviewed by the San Francisco Chronicle. Calo claims we are closer to the age of robots because of more powerful technology and slashed prices (reminiscent of Moore’s Law?) He points to Microsoft’s Kinect which sells for mere hundreds of dollars but would have cost thousands just three years back.
...
It reminds us of third party development for platforms like the iPhone and Android that then led to the proliferation of apps and other new uses for phones. Calo notes that this sort of openness within robotics comes with trepidation. He imagines the consequences if some bored hack decides to program his Roomba to play Frogger on a real highway.
Companies do not want to be held responsible for the craziness of humans. Calo believes that we need to start thinking about such situations and provide the same protections that were in place during the early days of the Internet. A small part of the Communications Decency Act of the 1990s that emerged intact from Supreme Court hearings, may be the savior of innovation. Section 230 states that the platform will not be liable as the publisher of what users publish. Imagine, Calo asks, if Facebook or Craigslist, or any news commenting system, would exist at all if such legality did not exist? This immunity helped pave the way to innovation in the Web. We need the same sort of immunity for manufactures of open robotics, says Calo. We cannot keep manufacturers liable for what the users might choose to program into their robots. If we do then companies like Willow Garage and others will simply not take the risk, and so academics are not able to quickly and voraciously experiment.
Calo points to what happened with Sony’s AIBO robot dog. Basically the software allows the user to raise it from puppy to dog, along with giving the dog a bunch of voice commands. Users wanted to expand so the enterprising ones wrote their own programs and applications and it turned into a “vibrant library that everyone was excited about.” But Sony intervened, sued over copyright issues, and the backlash caused Sony to close the entire line of AIBO. Later Sony rethought their decision and allowed the dog to ship with a software development kit included.
One of the more immediate examples of robots hanging out alongside us is the implementation of self-driving cars. This has already brought fear. The other week one of Google’s self-driving Prius’ slammed into another Prius. Google reported it had nothing to do with the software and the blame was on human error. Still, it makes us think of the possibilities. Calo commented:
…whether or not a crash involving an autonomous vehicle causes a backlash will depend on the circumstances. If an autonomous car is programmed to avoid strollers and shopping carts, but is confronted by both at once and swerves into stroller, then yes, robot driving is over in the United States. There’s a lot of fear of robots, so maybe not matter what, as soon as a robot car fatality happens, that’s it. But my hope is that it won’t. Hopefully, you’ll have thousands and thousands of hours of uneventful driving and you can point to the statistics that show we have enormously reduced fatalities.

Don't say we didn't warn you, carbon-based worker.

""Ultimately, American productivity is likely to go up."" SmartPlanet cites the proliferation open source robotic software and the continually decreasing cost of computer hardware as drives behind the rise of our robot overlords. Even so, the study in question from World Robotics may be projecting the robot totals low. Just this month we reported that a single company, Foxconn--maker of the iPhone and iPad--aims to have 1 million robot workers in its factories by 2014.

Technical manuals and popular fiction helped thrust robots into the popular imagination in the late 1970s, cast in the twin archetypes of mechanical monsters or tin sidekicks.
But for technical, financial and other reasons, the grand promise - or grave threat - of the rise of robots never came to pass. (We're still waiting on our jetpacks, too.)
Several decades later, Ryan Calo, a legal privacy expert at Stanford, believes we're finally on the precipice of a genuine robot revolution. He expects it will transform our everyday lives as much as the PC and Internet did.
Calo says the limitations that prevented robots from breaching the consumer marketplace - the occasional Roomba or toy pet notwithstanding - are falling away one by one. Robots can now climb walls, drive cars, perform surgery and fold laundry. Meanwhile, technology advances have sent prices tumbling.
...
Q: A lot of us could hardly imagine a world without PCs and the Internet today. How will robots similarly change our lives?
A: Initially, robots will enable people who can't do something today to do that thing.
The elderly or infirm who otherwise couldn't be in their homes independently because they needed some kind of assistance getting up or opening something, will suddenly be able to do those things. Or perhaps people who are too young or old or don't see well enough to drive will be able to get around because robotic systems will help them.
The truth is robots have touched all of our lives. They defend us, and they make a lot of the things we use and buy. If you've used Zappos.com or Diapers.com, then likely a robot went into the warehouse and retrieved the item.
But they're just kind of invisible to us. That will be the other big change: They'll be co-present.
You'll see them through the doorway that leads to the kitchen at restaurants, or in the hospital delivering samples. We'll start to see robots doing tasks that robots can probably do better or more efficiently.

37,"July 12, 2011",,,The Volokh Conspiracy,"Ryan Calo, CIS Director of Privacy and Robotics, is mentioned in the following article by Kenneth Anderson, writing for the legal blog, The Volokh Conspiracy, on the recent achievements of robot technology and the differences between ""open"" and ""closed"" robots:
I write a lot about drones and warfare, robotics on the battlefield and the legal questions it raises, but my interest in robotics is much broader than that. It extends to the effort to build and utilize (see, I resisted the battlefield word “deploy”) robots in society, and particularly in day to day interactions. For example, consider the use of robot technologies in the nursing profession and eldercare. Such uses might include from technologies more or less available now, such as machines that can take over the pickup and distribution of medicines in a nursing center, using existing warehouse technologies. But over time, we want technologies that don’t yet exist, such as robots that can assist the elderly in their homes in multiple ways such as walking assistance, carrying the groceries, etc. — as distinguished from single purpose, roomba-like appliances.
The New York Times has a good piece today in the Science section, by Robert Markoff, on the current level of achievement in robotics for tasks that you or I would find simple to master, such as folding laundry. For a robot, it is really hard. The difficulties are daunting in all three areas typically associated with robots — mechanics of movement, computational processing, and sensors. Markoff is particularly good at describing the “brittleness” of robot behavior.
...
... Stanford Law School scholar Ryan Calo (who is one of the few studying the intersection of law and robotics) has a new paper out on SSRN, Open Robotics, asking much more fundamental questions. It is summarized in a fine on-line essay here. Calo describes the difference between “closed” and “open” robotics:
“Closed” robots resemble any contemporary appliance: They are designed to perform a set task. They run proprietary software and are no more amenable to casual tinkering than a dishwasher. The popular Roomba robotic vacuum cleaner and the first AIBO mechanical pet are closed in this sense. “Open” robots are just the opposite. By definition, they invite contribution. An open robot has no predetermined function, runs third-party or even open-source software, and can be physically altered and extended without compromising performance.
“Open” systems are more valuable because they invite the development of more valuable and differentiated uses, building on pre-existing platforms. Open robotics follows the same path of the development of personal computing, able to run software created by third parties, thus creating vastly more value — value which, in no small part, lay in what someone might program the machine to do. So far so good, says Calo. But then, enter the lawyers.
The trouble with open platforms is that they open the manufacturer up to a universe of potential lawsuits. If a robot is built to do anything, it can do something bad. If it can run any software, it can run buggy or malicious software. The next killer app could, well, kill someone.
Liability in a closed world is fairly straightforward. A Roomba is supposed to do one thing and do it safely. Should the Roomba cause an injury in the course of vacuuming the floor, then iRobot generally will be held liable as it built the hardware and wrote or licensed the software. If someone hacks the Roomba and uses it to reenact the video game Frogger on the streets of Austin (this really happened), then iRobot can argue product misuse.
But what about in an open world? Open robots have no intended use. The hardware, the operating system, and the individual software — any of which could be responsible for an accident — might each have a different author. Open source software could have many authors. But plaintiffs will always sue the deep pockets. And courts could well place the burden on the defendants to sort it out.
An obvious question is why this was’t an issue in personal computing and its open model. The difference, Calo notes, is largely that when things went wrong in the computer world, the losses — especially in the early years, before they started running things like grids and plants and real-world systems — were intangible and digital. The point about robots, however, is that they act directly in the gross physical world, and so the nature of injuries is very different, from the very beginning:
The damage caused by home computers is intangible. The only casualties are bits. Courts were able to invoke doctrines such as economic loss, which provides that, in the absence of physical injury, a contracting party may recover no more than the value of the contract. Where damage from software is physical, however, when the software can touch you, lawsuits can and do gain traction. Examples include plane crashes based on navigation errors, the delivery of excessive levels of radiation in medical tests, and “sudden acceleration”—a charge respecting which it took a team of NASA scientists ten months to clear Toyota software of fault.
Open robots combine, arguably for the first time, the versatility, complexity, and collaborative ecosystem of a PC with the potential for physical damage or injury. The same norms and legal expedients do not necessarily apply. In robotics no less than in the context of computers or the Internet, the possibility that providers of a platform will be sued for what users do with their products may lead many to reconsider investing in the technology. At a minimum, robotics companies will have an incentive to pursue the slow, manageable route of closing their technology.
To recap: Robots may well be the next big thing in technology. The best way to foster innovation and to grow the consumer robotics industry is through an open model. But open robots also open robotic platform manufacturers to the potential for crippling liability for what users do with those platforms. Where do we go from here?

California's proposed do-not-track law would halt Internet innovation, break the economy and invite hackers to run wild, at least according to an assortment of tech companies and trade groups. It would also encourage terrorism, accelerate global warming and require Californians to drown puppies.
OK, we made that last part up.
But those first dire warnings were among the ones listed in a recent, sensationalized letter to state Sen. Alan Lowenthal, D-Long Beach, author of California's do-not-track bill. The predictable assortment of business groups, like the California Chamber of Commerce and Tech America, attached their name to the missive, along with companies including Google, Facebook and Yahoo.
...
The California proposal does grant the attorney general some leeway to create exemptions, but it's less defined. A federal law is also preferable to many because it creates a single set of standards. Asking regulators to set up overarching principles, rather than point-by-point legal mandates, makes more sense too, said Ryan Calo, director of Stanford's Consumer Privacy Project.

Calo said, however, he is more excited about interactive tools Facebook is proposing that would allow users to do things like build their own ad on Facebook, to demonstrate that the social network does not share an individual's data with advertisers targeting a specific demographic.

Microsoft's release Tuesday of a new Internet Explorer browser that includes a Do-Not-Track tool lets consumers signal advertisers and websites to stop tracking their movements on the Internet.
But it doesn't quite take the pressure off of regulators and lawmakers in the nation's capital to spell out rules about Internet and privacy. In fact, now they may have to specify what a website or an advertiser does with a Do-Not-Track request.

50,"March 1, 2011",,,Boston Review,"In the following article, the Boston Review covers Professor Barbara van Schewick's book titled Internet Architecture and Innovation. Evgeny Morozov reports:
In 2003 Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia Law School, published an article on the once-sleepy subject of telecommunications policy. In it, he coined the term “net neutrality” to capture the idea that network operators—the Comcasts and Verizons of the world—should not be in the business of regulating the information traffic that passes through their networks. The term took hold, and the article launched Wu to cyber-rock-star status.
Net neutrality is a simple idea with powerful implications. A neutral net would, for example, prevent cable providers from slowing down their customers’ connections or, worse, banning them from running certain services. That is good for customers, who get equal treatment whether they are streaming movies on Netflix, chatting on Skype, or shopping on Amazon. And it is also good for Netflix, Skype, and other companies that have grown using an Internet infrastructure they do not own and have been able to innovate without worrying about shifting rules of the road.
...
But could the information empire still be a useful concept in the net neutrality debate? Internet Architecture and Innovation, a new book by Stanford Law professor Barbara Van Schewick, shows that it is not. Reading Van Schewick’s book after Wu’s is like walking into a three-hour academic lecture after watching an eighteen-minute TED talk: while the lecture might seem too demanding at the outset, it eventually proves far more rewarding.
Internet Architecture and Innovation explores how changes in a system’s technical architecture and design affect the environment for innovation. Van Schewick argues that modularity—the degree to which a system’s components can be designed, produced, and used independently of one another—is a defining feature of systems. Lego blocks and personal computers score high on modularity; automobiles, less so. In highly modular systems, designers of a particular module can treat all other modules as black boxes; the design of their own module is independent of how other modules are designed or connected. In general, high modularity is good for innovation, as it provides designers with flexibility while also narrowing their focus to a single problem.
...
Van Schewick argues that the pioneers of the Internet recognized the network’s revolutionary potential, so instead of optimizing for performance or cost at such an early stage, they decided to maximize long-term evolvability. And that meant keeping the network core as simple and unspecialized as possible.
It is possible that the trade-off made by computer scientists in the 1980s may no longer reflect the needs of today. “If we believe that all important applications have been realized,” Van Schewick writes, advocating on behalf of the devil, “there is no need to incur the costs of keeping the Internet open for new applications.” But given that there was no Kindle, iPad, or Twitter just five years ago, that belief is a foolish one. As Van Schewick puts it, “Leaving the evolution of the network to network providers will significantly reduce the Internet’s value to society.” In other words, a non-discriminatory—neutral—Internet is in all our interests.
Most provocatively, Van Schewick argues that even the presence of competition may not succeed in thwarting discriminatory practices. And here is where she undermines Wu’s claims about information empires.

51,"February 11, 2011",,,Los Angeles Times,"Lecturer Ryan Calo spoke with David Sarno of the Los Angeles Times about the recent bill sponsored by Rep Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) to force online marketers to comply with consumer requests to not be tracked. Here is the story:
A privacy bill introduced in Congress on Friday raised the possibility that Internet users will be able to prevent advertisers from tracking what they do online.
Similar to the 2003 Do Not Call Registry that prevents telemarketers from calling consumers who don't want to be contacted, the ""Do Not Track"" bill would allow the Federal Trade Commission to force online advertisers to respect the wishes of users who do not want to be tracked for marketing purposes.
""Failure to do so would be considered an unfair or deceptive act punishable by law,"" said a statement from the office of Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough), who is sponsoring the bill.
...
""It really is a strong pro-consumer bill,"" said Ryan Calo, director of the Consumer Privacy Project at Stanford Law School, who noted that the bill's teeth included provisions that would allow state prosecutors to go after privacy violators if the FTC didn't have time or resources.

The debate around online privacy has largely centered around advertising that is targeted at people depending on where they have been online. While somewhat creepy, those ads are perhaps the least of our worries. What many of us don't realize is that there are multiple parties tracking our moves online, some harmless and some possibly nefarious.
In fact, one of our MediaShift readers pointed out that PBS.org itself has at least seven trackers on its site:
I found that on the PBS.org site there are 7 trackers active, they are AddtoAny, Comscore Beacon, Disqus, DoubleClick, Foresee, Google AdSense, and Google Analytics...I found these because I use a Firefox add-on called 'Ghostery' that blocks trackers.

53,"February 9, 2011",,,Business Week - Bloomberg,"Lecturer M. Ryan Calo speaks with Business Week's Michael Riley about the idea of using hacking as a form of civil disobedience:
Evidence collected by the FBI about Anonymous, which attacked websites of four companies to punish them for blocking contributions to WikiLeaks, will be considered this week by a U.S. grand jury, according to court papers and an informal spokesman for the group of activist hackers.
The federal grand jury in San Jose, California, will begin reviewing evidence tomorrow that includes computers and mobile phones seized from suspected leaders as prosecutors probe the coordinated so-called denial-of-service attacks in December, according to a federal subpoena and the spokesman, Barrett Brown. Anonymous directed activists to target payment processors MasterCard Inc., Visa Inc., EBay Inc.’s PayPal, and U.K.-based Moneybookers.com in public chat rooms.

“Civil disobedience is historically more effective when the state intervenes in a heavy-handed way,” said Ryan Calo, an expert in cyber crime at Stanford University in Stanford, California. “It is not just the act but also all the follow-up -- the subpoenas, arrests, a trial. That’s all part of the act of civil disobedience.”

Nearly seven out of 10 Facebook members surveyed — and 52% of Google users — say they are either “somewhat” or “very concerned” about their privacy while using the world’s most popular social network and dominant search engine.
Even so, technologists and privacy experts say most people lack a clear grasp of the complex risks they accept whenever they’re on the Internet. “Consumers generally do not understand who’s getting access to their data and for what purpose,” says Ryan Calo, director of the Consumer Privacy Project at the Stanford University Center for Internet and Society.

Odds are you will be monitored today — many times over.
Surveillance cameras at airports, subways, banks and other public venues are not the only devices tracking you. Inexpensive, ever-watchful digital sensors are now ubiquitous.
They are in laptop webcams, video-game motion sensors, smartphone cameras, utility meters, passports and employee ID cards. Step out your front door and you could be captured in a high-resolution photograph taken from the air or street by Google or Microsoft, as they update their respective mapping services. Drive down a city thoroughfare, cross a toll bridge, or park at certain shopping malls and your license plate will be recorded and time-stamped.
...
Ryan Calo, director of the Consumer Privacy Project at the Stanford (University) Center for Internet and Society, can imagine an escalation of troubling scenarios. Advertisers could customize pitches in sneakier ways. Or worse, data correlated from multiple sensors could be used to deny you a job, cut you off from insurance coverage or lower your credit status.

56,"January 11, 2011",,,Forbes Blog,"M. Ryan Calo, director of the Consumer Privacy Project, is mentioned in the following article clarifying some of his earlier comments on the effects of Wikileaks on free speech online:
In the world o’ privacy that I inhabit, there are currently two huge stories subject to much public discussion. The first is the Department of Justice’s investigation of Wikileaks supporters’ activity on Twitter and the second is th government’s plan for a “trusted ID system for cyberspace.” In both cases, privacy experts are happy to see privacy concerns getting full play in the discussion, but annoyed to find their views distorted for the sake of a media narrative.
Luckily, thanks to this Internet thingy we have, those experts get to respond and rebuke, accordingly…
...
The Twitter-DoJ kerfuffle led to a piece in the New York Times suggesting that digital privacy laws need updating, as law enforcement is increasingly turning to tech companies for information in the course of investigations. The main law governing what and how they can get what they get dates back to 1986, when a tweet was only something a bird did and facebook would refer solely to a text on the human visage. The piece quoted Ryan Calo, director of the consumer privacy project at the Center for Internet & Society at Stanford Law School, defending the government’s need to collect data:
“When your job is to protect us by fighting and prosecuting crime, you want every tool available. No one thinks D.O.J. and other investigative agencies are sitting there twisting their mustache trying to violate civil liberties. They’re trying to do their job.”
That sounds odd coming from a consumer privacy expert… and rightly so. Calo responded to the piece saying this gave a misleading impression of his views on the privacy issues:
""This particular remark was an aside, made if anything to soften the impression that I was overly critical of the government. For instance, I lamented that consumers do not understand the state of the electronic privacy law and spoke about the dangers of dragnet or otherwise excessive surveillance. (Presumably I am one of the unnamed “[e]lectronic privacy and civil rights advocates” that worries “because the WikiLeaks court order gained such widespread attention, it could have a chilling effect on people’s speech on the Internet.”)
I did not mean to imply that we should not push back against government and in fact praised Google and Twitter for having done so.

57,"January 6, 2011",,,The Stanford Daily,"Lecturer Ryan Calo is mentioned in the following article about a new California Senate bill addressing cyberbullying via social networking websites. The Stanford Daily reports:
Senate Bill 1411, authored by Sen. Joe Simitian, D-Palo Alto, confronts the new dangers of social networking websites such as Myspace and Facebook. In effect since Jan. 1, the law makes online impersonation intended to “harm, intimidate or defraud” someone illegal. Offenders may face up to a year in prison and a $1,000 fine.
Although SB 1411 confronts a significant problem in the digital age, it has received criticism from some legal scholars alleging the new law could infringe on the First Amendment right to free speech. The law attempts to address this problem through a clause stating that parody or satire is acceptable and that malicious intent must be apparent.
Ryan Calo, the director of the Consumer Privacy Project at Stanford Law School, warns that the line between harmful intent and satire remains blurred. It’s difficult to point exactly to acts of impersonation that are threatening, intimidating or defrauding, according to Calo.
“Reasonable people will disagree whether an impersonation falls within these categories,” Calo said.
Although the bill provides both a criminal penalty and a civil action penalty for online impersonation, Calo believes the law’s vagueness allows for misinterpretation.
“The danger is that people will do something that is funny or controversial that might possibly fall under this law,” Calo said. “It’s not realistic to think that this will focus on the crime that we’re worried about.”
He suggests, for example, that private litigates may use the law as a reason to justify lawsuits that would otherwise be unfounded.
Despite the criticisms legal scholars have of SB 1411, Calo acknowledges the bill sends a signal to potential cyberbullies that their actions can result in serious legal consequences.
He stresses, however, that SB 1411 is just one solution to the growing problem of online impersonation and emphasized the need for private entities to act more responsibly online.
“Laws are not the only way to address this behavior,” Calo said. “Companies could do more to cut down on harmful behavior online.”

There's a poignant observation by Gabriel García Márquez I'd like to share with you, “Everyone has three lives: a public life, a private life, and a secret life.” Which do you broadcast?
The social web is not powered by technology as much as it is by people. While it is the responsibility of social networks and services to ensure that privacy settings are in our control, as well as easy to understand and manage, the consequences of our actions ultimately fall on us. And as a result, what we say, share, and do online is there for others to discover. The web has a long memory and what people discover is usually theirs to interpret without the benefit of our explanation. As it is today, we're reactive rather than proactive with the digital shadows we cast.

60,"December 2, 2010",,,Stanford Report,"Fellow Ryan Calo discusses the potential future of a new ""do not track"" software, which was created by a pair of Stanford researchers:
As a government agency pushes for a ""do not track"" mechanism to protect online consumer privacy, a pair of Stanford researchers is developing the technology to make it work.
For about four months before Wednesday's release of the Federal Trade Commission's recommendations for increasing Internet privacy, Jonathan Mayer and Arvind Narayanan have been creating software that would let users opt out of third-party web tracking and tell advertisers to stop following them online.
""People get creeped out by some of the advertising that happens online,"" said Mayer, who is working toward a PhD in computer science and a law degree. ""What concerns us is if you're on a site like Amazon and you go looking for shoes, then someone tells a behavioral advertising service that you've been looking for shoes. So the next time you're off on another shopping site, they'll ask if you're still looking for shoes. It feels invasive.""
...
""At the end of day, Congress would probably have to pass a law empowering the FTC to enforce this,"" said Ryan Calo, director of the Consumer Privacy Project for Stanford Law School's Center for Internet and Society. Mayer is a student fellow at the center, and Narayanan – a postdoctoral researcher in computer science – is a junior affiliate scholar at the center.
""The FTC could also say they are responsible for policing the Internet for deceptive and unfair practices, so if a consumer says he doesn't want to be tracked and you track him, that can be seen as an unfair practice,"" Calo said. ""But to get the proper amount of teeth behind something like this, you really need Congress to act.""
...
""We always thought Do Not Track was a great technical idea, and it has a real impact that's feasible,"" Mayer said. ""Now having the FTC say it's a good idea – you just can't ask for more than that on a research project.""

The idea of a Do Not Track list for web users has been kicked around for a while. After the relative success of the Do Not Call telemarketing list, it seems like an easy and practical way for people to choose not to be tracked around the Internet by online advertisers.
Imagine going to a store at the mall. You do your shopping, you pay, and then you walk out the door. Except someone from the store follows you. They get in your car, they write down what other stores you go to and what you shop for there. Then they bring you advertisements of things you might want to buy. Convenient? Maybe a little. But kind of a loss of privacy too and more than a little creepy.
...
We also talk to Jonathan Mayer, a senior fellow at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society and one of the people behind donottrack.us, a project to develop a way to opt out.

62,"November 2, 2010",,,Business Week - Bloomberg,"Director of the Consumer Privacy Project Ryan Calo is quoted in the following story on the highly competitive atmosphere of the robot industry. Business Week's Joel Stonington reports:
Robots build our cars and electronics. They sort packages with ease, lift enormous weights, and perform microsurgeries too small for the human eye. In Afghanistan, robots are fighting our wars. What they can't do is share an operating system.
Today approximately 8.6 million robots are around the world, according to IFR World Robotics. That's equal to roughly the population of New Jersey. And most of these have been designed from scratch. For years, tinkerers in garages, professors at universities, and scientists at corporations have essentially been reinventing the wheel each time they develop a new robot. That means designing the hardware and writing the code that drives the actions. From robot welders to robot vacuum cleaners, the robotics industry at this point is essentially siloed.
But maybe not for much longer. Enormous profits await the company that could become the Microsoft (MSFT) of the robotic world. ""There is competition over who is going to have the dominant operating system for robots,"" says Ryan Calo, director of the Consumer Privacy Project at Stanford University's Center for Internet and Society.
Standards are essential to the development and adaptation of technology. Competing standards confuse consumers and hinder progress. For example, the competition between Sony's (SNE) Blu-ray DVD system and Toshiba's (TOSYY:OTC) HD DVD system hurt sales of both systems. The logjam was resolved in 2008 when Toshiba announced it would stop manufacturing its system. As Calo says, ""There are a bunch of groups that want to make the top operating system. It really matters.""
...
By open, Calo says it needs to be ""nondedicated as to use, nondiscriminatory as to software, and modular in design."" That's what Willow Garage is going for, as well.
...
""It turns out to be next to impossible to debug software,"" Calo says. ""You can have a sense of what a program is going to do, but getting it 100 percent right is not possible.""

""This is software that can touch you,"" Calo says. ""Unlike devices in the past, these machines can cause physical damage.""

“Online privacy” is a hot topic across the country these days. Our spending tons of time on the Internet and revealing lots about ourselves is not a particularly new phenomenon, but it seems to have finally caught the sustained attention of lawmakers and federal regulators in Washington, D.C.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg can attest to the attention: he has a growing collection of letters from U.S. congressmen about his site’s privacy issues. Eventually, Congress is going to do more than just write angry letters to 26-year-old CEOs. There are bills and proposals floating around the Hill, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and the Commerce Department. Most insiders believe that privacy protection is ultimately going to fall into the arms of the FTC.

That evolution in thinking about privacy harm may be traced back to Ryan Calo, a researcher at Stanford, who wrote a paper on the topic. Calo is part of an influential group of privacy thinkers (many of whom are law professors) who are trying to guide D.C. in its approach to privacy.

I expect the book to affect how people think about the Internet; about the interactions between law and technical architectures in all areas of law; about entrepreneurship in general.

69,"August 27, 2010",,,The Wall Street Journal Digits Blog,"Ryan Calo, a senior research fellow at the Center for Internet & Society, is interviewed by Jennifer Valentino-DeVries of the Wall Street Journal Digits Blog about issues of ""privacy harm"" and topics included in his forthcoming paper, ""The Boundaries of Privacy Harm"":
In debates about online privacy, one question always seems to crop up: What’s the harm? How can harm come from a breach of privacy if there’s no fraud and the information isn’t used for, say, identity theft? When the only thing that seems to be wrong is a feeling of “creepiness,” what should that be called?
Ryan Calo, senior research fellow at the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford University Law School, has been trying to answer that question. This summer, he released a draft of a paper titled the Boundaries of Privacy Harm that is set to be published in the Indiana Law Journal next year.
Calo spoke with Digits about privacy harm and how it applies in the digital world. His condensed comments are below.
Why do we need to define privacy harm?
If you look at regulations of abortion or sodomy or contraception, the Supreme Court looked at these as privacy issues. But a lot of people would say you can’t regulate sex between two people of the same gender, not because it happens in private but because it’s an equality issue. … In order to surface these values, we need to draw a line and say that not everything is privacy.
Then there are times when we look at a situation and … we say, “Ah, this looks weird,” but we don’t know what is wrong and more importantly don’t know how to deal with it, but it’s privacy. One example we use is the targeting of spam or the targeting of elderly people for “sucker lists” to get ads for gold coins. People are making lists on the basis of vulnerability characteristics, or in the case of spam combing the Internet finding information in the form of an email address.
So what is a privacy harm?
In the paper I use the analogy of assault and battery [to describe two types of harm -- called “subjective” and “objective”]. Assault is apprehension about getting hit, and it’s separate in court. You can go after someone for making you feel like they’re about to hit you. Battery is actually getting hit.
Subjective privacy harm can be triggered if you’re creeped out. … Objective privacy harm is when a person’s information is used against that person [as in a denial of a job or a malicious attack].
In your paper you distinguish what you call a “privacy violation” from what you call a “privacy harm.” What’s the difference there? The term “privacy violation” still sounds pretty harmful.
It might be easiest to look at this by considering an analogy. It’s obvious why you’re required to stop at a red light: If you run the light and hit someone, that’s clearly harm. But in the middle of the night, if there is nobody there, you can run it and there’s no harm. But technically you violated the law; it’s a violation.
If people do not know about being watched, there could be a privacy violation but no privacy harm.
There also are plenty of times when there is a harm and no violation, no one to blame. I can think of incidents where somebody suffers privacy harm, but it’s entirely incidental.
In the paper I even go to the extent to say that people who are paranoid, delusional and believe they are constantly being observed — I realize that sounds absurd, but this person still might feel concerns and be harmed.
Where would all this go in terms of the actual law?
In writing an academic piece I felt the need to own the logical conclusion of my theory; I wouldn’t say you would legislate a privacy violation if a paranoid schizophrenic is delusional.
But many privacy claims fail for lack of harm. Harm has often operated as a hurdle because courts have a very difficult time articulating what the harm is. They just are not sure that psychological perceptions constitute a harm.
There was a case where the government engaged in massive surveillance, but the plaintiff failed to articulate just how it affected them. These are real harms, though, and they actually are measurable. People don’t think it is measurable, but there’s a lot of social science out there that indicates that it is.
Does privacy harm require that personally identifiable information be used?
Both harms of my privacy test can be triggered without that.
The standard industry defense is that, yes, we do track consumers, but we don’t know it’s them, so who cares? To some extent it makes sense.
But take the example of someone who goes through a messy divorce and suddenly gets ads for singles. They might start to think, “Oh my God, does Facebook know I’m single? Do they think I need to improve? Who has this information?” But then you go to Facebook, and Facebook says, “We didn’t know it was you. The advertiser doesn’t know. We just know someone has gone through a messy breakup.”
But imagine a government system that just combed through everything and sent [messages] for all the times people mentioned they did marijuana, and you went to them and said, “This is a horrible invasion of my privacy,” and they just said, “I didn’t know it was you.” It doesn’t matter!
On the objective [harm] side, it only matters in the extent to which the information provides a key to [acting against] the person.
What about situations we see where the information is public but people feel there is a privacy harm?
One of the biggest problems in privacy is the notion of private and public. According to the law, if you go outside and something happens to you and someone records it, you don’t have any expectation of privacy.
But people have agitated about that, and there are so-called upskirt laws [related to inappropriate photos], so there’s some recognition that there’s nuance there. My hope is that my theory does some work to add more rigorous nuance to the notion of private and public.
So even if you’re in public, one factor is the extent to which monitoring is unwanted. In another, like if there are CCTV cameras everywhere, it might not be noticed or unwanted but is invasive, excessive.
But also there are many cases where people suffer low-level privacy harm, but we don’t want to throw the law at the other person.
What about if people post something online and then feel harm later?
Perhaps user-generated content is like privacy in public. Since you put the photo or comment out there, the level of “unwantedness” … is low. But there could still be a very invasive use, for instance, if I created a packet of your worst moments across multiple websites … and sent it to potential employers or dates. Maybe we’d still want to call that a privacy harm.
If I upload something I’m perfectly comfortable with at the time but then later on I start to get concerned and attempt to take it down and can’t, then in my theory I begin to experience subjective privacy harm.
My opinion on this is that is it’s a shared responsibility between the user and the platform. And for the platform, the considerations are: 1) Does your interface help people anticipate consequences and 2) Do you help make it possible to change them?

70,"August 25, 2010",,,,"Sarah Hinchcliff Pearson, residential fellow at the Center for Internet and Society, is quoted on potentially requiring bloggers to buy a business license if their blog recieves advertising revenue. Kamala Lane of Washington Internet Daily reports:
The Philadelphia Revenue Department's attempt to require bloggers to buy a business privilege license if their blog receives advertising revenue could be a deterrent for prospective bloggers, some Internet advocates and lawyers said. The license must be bought by anyone doing business in the city and costs $50 a year or $300 for the life of the business, said the Revenue Department. The fee is not an attempt to tax bloggers, said Doug Oliver, a spokesman for Mayor Michael Nutter. ""Everyone from Comcast to Starbucks to a pizza joint has to have business privilege licenses,"" including freelance artists like performers and musicians.
""There are people who do things because they have a passion for it, and there are those times when your passion becomes a profession,"" which then becomes a business, Oliver said. Enforcing the law is an effort to provide clarity to the arts and entertainment community and to collect taxes from people who reported making a profit to the IRS, but didn't pay taxes locally, he said. The city sent out about 30,000 letters, a Revenue Department spokeswoman said. The recipients included bloggers and letters were received from May 3 to June 25, during the city's tax amnesty period, she said.

If treating blogging as a business becomes widespread, speech on the Internet could be affected, some Internet freedom advocates and lawyers said. It does have the potential to stifle free speech online, said Sarah Hinchliff Pearson of the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law.

But ""the vast majority aren't money-making endeavors. People are doing it in their spare time and if they have to jump through hoops they won't blog for fear of being taxed.""
...
The larger issue is how the city intends to determine the threshold for being considered a business and how it will enforce the law, they said. ""I'm not sure how you'd figure out who would fall under the tax,"" Pearson said. ""The Internet isn't local and it seems like they would waste a lot of resources to try to figure out the threshold and enforce the law."" ""I'd be surprised if they spent a lot of their resources to aggressively enforce this,"" Donovan said. ""They have bigger fish to fry.""

","Essential new book on 'Net Policy (blessed by Lessig!): ""Internet Architecture and Innovation""",Architecture and Public Policy
72,"August 11, 2010",,,Ammori.org,"Professor Barbara van Schewick's book, Internet Architecture and Innovation, is reviewed by Center for Internet and Society visiting scholar, Marvin Ammori, on his website:
There’s a new book out on Internet policy that is essential reading for anyone interested in Internet policy—and probably for anyone interested in the law, economics, technology, or start-ups. I recommend it to everyone. It’s that good.
Barbara van Schewick’s new book, “Internet Architecture and Innovation,” is one of the very few books in my field in the same league as Larry Lessig’s Code, in 2000, and Yochai Benkler’s Wealth of Networks, in 2006, in terms of its originality, depth, and importance to Internet policy and other disciplines. I expect the book to affect how people think about the Internet; about the interactions between law and technical architectures in all areas of law; about entrepreneurship in general. I also think her insights on innovation economics, which strike me as far more persuasive than lawyers’ usual assumptions, should influence “law and economics” thinking for the better.
...
Barbara van Schewick is well-known to Internet lawyers as a brilliant, extremely thorough lawyer. And engineer. And expert on innovation economics. She was (with Yale’s Jack Balkin and Harvard’s Charles Nesson) one of three academics joining consumer groups to prompt the FCC’s 2008 investigation of Comcast interferinge with peer-to-peer technologies like BitTorrent. The FCC’s 2009 open Internet proposal, in its background policy discussion, cites her scholarly work far more than any other scholar. Her law review articles advance novel, seminal critiques of what economists considered “conventional wisdom” on the one-monopoly profit principle and the role of competition in ensuring open technology platforms. This scholarship was influential not only in the US, but also in Europe and Canada’s recent Internet policy proceeding.
...
This is one of those rare books where every chapter is full of novel and important ideas. But I’ll tell you about my very favorite part. In the eighth chapter, beginning with “The Value of Many Innovators,” van Schewick presents the stories of how several major technologies were born: Google, Flickr, EBay, 37Signals, Twitter, and even the World Wide Web, email, and web-based email. I had always suspected that the “accidental” beginnings and unexpected successes of these technologies were a series flukes, one fluke after another. Rather, van Schewick explains, it’s a pattern. Her models actually predict the pattern accurately–unlike other academic models like the efficient market hypothesis and theories on valuing derivatives. These entrepreneurial stories (or case studies, to academics) are eye-opening; they’re also counter-intuitive unless you consider the management science and evolutionary economics van Schewick applies to analyze them. So if you wondered what the invention of Flickr, Google, Twitter, and the World Wide Web had in common, van Schewick answers the question.
...
But don’t be so intimidated by the title that you miss out on van Schewick’s important ideas.
For the terminally intimidated, I recommend beginning with van Schewick’s short, concrete, straight-forward testimony to governments (see here and here and here) and an amicus brief.
...
For others, I will list the things-that-I-know-scare-you-but-should-not.
1. Her name. “van Schewick.” What an intimidating, scary German name, worthy of a Dr. Strangelove scene or an Austin Powers movie. I know. But no worries. Despite her meticulous thoroughness, her German accent, and her “van”–her academic writing is gentle and clear. It’s not turgid like those H-Germans, Habermas or Heidegger. In fact, she knows her book “crosses a number of disciplines,” like engineering, economics, and law and had consciously aimed to make it “accessible to all” of us who have different backgrounds. There are zero equations in the text. And equations can be scary to lawyers and law students.
2. Equations. Nope. No need to worry. Not one of those books.
3. The difficult concepts. van Schewick is addressing difficult questions. She is not addressing fluff. But that’s a strength. She cuts through the complexity to put her finger on the key issues, to address all counterarguments and angles, and to make sense of it for the reader.
4. Length. It is almost 400 pages. But van Schewick includes several shortcuts–like three charts of page references as guides for reading the book to answer particular questions. (Policymakers will likely rely on those charts.) The way I look at it: the book itself is a short-cut. It may take one or two weeks to read. To get a similar grasp of these issues, I would otherwise have had to spend ten long years locked in a library, reading and analyzing the global literature on Internet engineering, economics and innovation, legal policy, and business-managerial decision-making, all while speaking often to the top thinkers worldwide in all these areas and eating brain foods to increase my mental ability to keep up with the task. But, luckily for me, van Schewick spent a decade exploring all these issues, apparently locked in the architectural economist’s equivalent of the Room of Requirement, surrounded by books, some full of equations, and top experts.
5. Abstraction. The book at times sets forth general frameworks and arguments that go beyond, and therefore abstract from, particular stories and economic conditions. Very abstract models can be hard to wrap the mind around. But van Schewick’s models are not too abstract. Plus, a model for understanding complexity is the point of the book (and of most non-fiction books I have read, from The Tipping Point and Outliers to Freakanomics and The Origin of the Species). Such books are meant to make broader sense of particular phenomena.
",Internet Policy: Most Important Book In Years is Now Out,Architecture and Public Policy
73,"August 10, 2010",,,The New York Times - Room for Debate,"Professor Barbara van Schewick's book Internet Architecture and Innovation, is mentioned in this New York Times editorial on net neutrality by Lawrence Lessig, founder of Stanford's Center for Internet and Society:
The word from Washington is that the White House is pressuring, or more diplomatically, “signaling” the F.C.C. to go slow on Barack Obama’s promise to protect “network neutrality.” The depressingly familiar reason why this might be so is that the White House has finally awoken to the huge political costs that this vital economic principle would incur. The less depressing, but also familiar reason is that senior economic policy types in the White House are continuing on their deregulatory crusade, facts notwithstanding.
That crusade was inexcusable when it came to the debacle on Wall Street. Even if economists hadn’t learned this, history had long taught the consequences of feeding a nontransparent financial market (as derivatives were) with government funds and guarantees. Willed obliviousness may have paid souls on Wall Street well, but it was a disaster for the rest of the economy.
...
As much as anything else, the economic success of the Internet comes from its architecture. The architecture, and the competitive forces it assures, is the only interesting thing at stake in this battle over “network neutrality.” And yet, the most senior economic advisers in the White House don’t seem to know what that means. They could, if they took the time. Barbara van Schewick’s extraordinary new book, ""Internet Architecture and Innovation,"" is perhaps the best explication of this point so far for those who should be studying these hard, new policy questions.

In the end, she concludes that the architecture of the internet is changing - that the economic interests of the internet access providers are not the same as the interests of the applications developers or end users, that there is not enough competition in the local loop to provide market discipline, so without intervention, innovation on the Internet will suffer.

Others, of course, like Root Market years ago, have tried making a business from trading click streams and other online personal information on behalf of consumers. But part of the calculation by the start-up, Bynamite, is that these days, the data are far richer and the technology has matured enough to make such a service easy to use, effective and flexible.

76,"July 19, 2010",,,,"Ryan Calo, a residential fellow at the Center for Internet & Society, talked to reporter Louis Traeger about the legality of regulating privacy rules for various service providers:
AT&T thinks restrictions on collecting and using information about customers and their actions online should be reduced for telcos and raised to the same level for cable companies and Web publishers, an executive said. Telcos come under ""rules that other players in the environment don't have,"" and they apply beyond the wireline voice business that has long been heavily regulated, said Sherry Ramsey, assistant vice president for regulatory planning and policy.
""We just want to have a level playing field and participate in the same way as other players,"" Ramsey said at a meeting of the Telecom Council of Silicon Valley late Thursday. What's needed for everyone are ""common-sense privacy rules"" based on the Fair Information Practices, she said.
Ryan Calo, who runs the consumer privacy project of the Stanford Center for Internet & Society, agreed that all service providers should come under the same rules for secondary uses, third-party sharing and security of user information. But he indicated that the rules for other companies should be raised without lowering those for telcos. The restrictions on carriers are appropriate not only because they ""are heavily regulated in general,"" but also because they vacuum up vast amounts of information ""by virtue of providing a service,"" Calo said.
The FCC and the FTC are ""struggling"" with ""who is supposed to be regulating in this space and with what authority,"" Calo said. He called it a ""turf war."" Calo added, ""You don't want these agencies regulating too much.""
It's in Internet companies' interest to hold themselves to privacy rules beyond those imposed by government, no matter how odd that sounds, Calo said. That corporate approach is needed for ""brand protection and trust,"" he said. There's ""ample evidence"" that companies which follow this path ""succeed"" and those that don't ""have PR disasters,"" Calo said.
...
Privacy-protecting technology businesses are emerging in the business-to-business and business-to-consumer markets, speakers said. Calo talked up Abine, whose browser plug-in is billed as managing a user's passwords, dealings with Web cookies and beacons and other personal information matters online. He puts more stock in technology tools than ""bills of rights,"" which are by nature ""aspirational,"" he said.

Jeffrey Rosen files this story:
Four years ago, Stacy Snyder, then a 25-year-old teacher in training at Conestoga Valley High School in Lancaster, Pa., posted a photo on her MySpace page that showed her at a party wearing a pirate hat and drinking from a plastic cup, with the caption “Drunken Pirate.” After discovering the page, her supervisor at the high school told her the photo was “unprofessional,” and the dean of Millersville University School of Education, where Snyder was enrolled, said she was promoting drinking in virtual view of her under-age students. As a result, days before Snyder’s scheduled graduation, the university denied her a teaching degree. Snyder sued, arguing that the university had violated her First Amendment rights by penalizing her for her (perfectly legal) after-hours behavior. But in 2008, a federal district judge rejected the claim, saying that because Snyder was a public employee whose photo didn’t relate to matters of public concern, her “Drunken Pirate” post was not protected speech.
When historians of the future look back on the perils of the early digital age, Stacy Snyder may well be an icon. The problem she faced is only one example of a challenge that, in big and small ways, is confronting millions of people around the globe: how best to live our lives in a world where the Internet records everything and forgets nothing — where every online photo, status update, Twitter post and blog entry by and about us can be stored forever. With Web sites like LOL Facebook Moments, which collects and shares embarrassing personal revelations from Facebook users, ill-advised photos and online chatter are coming back to haunt people months or years after the fact. Examples are proliferating daily: there was the 16-year-old British girl who was fired from her office job for complaining on Facebook, “I’m so totally bored!!”; there was the 66-year-old Canadian psychotherapist who tried to enter the United States but was turned away at the border — and barred permanently from visiting the country — after a border guard’s Internet search found that the therapist had written an article in a philosophy journal describing his experiments 30 years ago with L.S.D.
...
A silly but surprisingly effective alternative might be to have an anthropomorphic icon — a stern version of Microsoft’s Clippy — that could give you a reproachful look before you hit the send button. According to M. Ryan Calo, who runs the consumer-privacy project at Stanford Law School, experimenters studying strategies of “visceral notice” have found that when people navigate a Web site in the presence of a human-looking online character who seems to be actively following the cursor, they disclose less personal information than people who browse with no character or one who appears not to be paying attention. As people continue to experience the drawbacks of living in a world that never forgets, they may well learn to hesitate before posting information, with or without humanoid Clippys.

Does your head hurt yet? Are you energized with outrage? That’s understandable. Still, when it comes to hate speech, consider giving Facebook a break, suggests Ryan Calo, legal fellow at Stanford Law School’s Center for Internet & Society. (He knows about these things.)
“Companies like Facebook have a tough time navigating hate speech,” Calo said in a telephone interview. “Not only do they have to pick winners in content, they have to do it on a global scale. If they take down content because it offends one group of people, they end up offending another group.”
You can’t accuse Facebook of censorship! No really, you can’t. Censorship is solely the province of the government, which is optimally prevented from such actions by the First Amendment — the same amendment that allows Facebook to govern what you put on its site.
Just like IRL (in real life), you can’t threaten the life of the president, as one young rube implied with an “assassination” vote soon after Barack Obama was elected. And the social network does look to the First Amendment as a guide post when it comes to content, Calo pointed out. For example, “obscene” material, as interpreted from the First Amendment, is considered “obscene” on Facebook, too.
To its credit, Calo added, Facebook tends to err on the side of allowing potentially objectionable content, even as it has the ability to block such content in countries where it’s against the law. And he advocates sympathy for the social network as it operates in a global environment, noting that values, mores and laws vary greatly between countries.

87,"May 12, 2010",,,Concurring Opinions,"Ryan Calo, a residential fellow at the Center for Internet & Society, talks to Danielle Citron of Concurring Opinions about his research in the field of robotics and the law:
Once just fantasy, robots are increasingly prevalent in the twenty-first century. Ryan Calo, a Senior Research Fellow at the Stanford Center for Internet Society, has been doing fascinating research on the topic. Along with his work at Stanford, Calo serves on the programming group for National Robotics Week and will be co-chairing the Committee on Robotics and Artificial Intelligence for the ABA. (He also tweets about privacy and robotics at twitter.com/rcalo). This month’s ABA Magazine has a terrific article discussing Calo’s work and I wanted to follow up on that piece with an interview of my own. I reproduce my discussion with Calo below.
DC: Tell our readers about your research on robotics.
RC: Thanks very much for your interest. I’m researching essentially two aspects of robotics and the law. First, I’m looking at the potential impact of robots on society—for instance, with respect to privacy—and whether existing laws suffice to address this impact. Second, I’m investigating what the right legal infrastructure might be to promote safety and accountability but also to preserve the conditions for innovation. In each case, my focus has been on “personal” or “service” robots, a rapidly expanding category of consumer technology that encompasses everything from a Roomba to a humanoid Nao. I’m also interested in autonomous vehicles and vehicles features such as lane departure prevention.
DC: What are the most pressing concerns now and what issues do you foresee as pressing in the future?
RC: Today the most pressing concern is the military’s use of robotics. Literally thousands of robots have been deployed in the field, with more on the way. Peter Singer has marshaled extensive evidence that robots may skew individual and military priorities in some instances. On the one hand, I agree that we should be worried about our increased capacity and willingness to kill at a distance. On the other, as Ken Anderson has pointed out, robots may allow for more surgical strikes on enemy targets, reducing so-called “collateral damage” to civilians and infrastructure.
The second pressing concern is the uncertainty around liability for what end-users do with robots. Robots share two key similarities with computers and software: (1) responsibility can be difficult to parse in the event of a malfunction or accident and (2) many of the innovative uses of robotics will be determined by end-users. We’ve managed to domesticate the issue of computer liability with doctrines such as economic loss; you cannot sue Microsoft because Word ate your term paper. But this option is unlikely to be on the table with robots that can cause corporeal harm.
We need to get this issue of liability right. Would you build robots or invest in robotics if you were uncertain of your legal risk? Would you build versatile, “generative” platforms (to borrow a term from Jonathan Zittrain) if you might be held accountable for whatever users do with those platforms? I wouldn’t.
DC: What are the broad areas of law most implicated by advances in robotics?
RC: I believe that robots will eventually have an impact on many, if not all, areas of the law. If we’re talking the next ten years, I would list three in particular: product liability, privacy, and labor law.
Product liability: Classic notions in product liability law will not function well in the context of robotics. Take foreseeability: the possibility of harm is obvious, but its exact mechanism will be extremely difficult to predict and guard or warn against. Or take proximate cause: candidates for why a robot caused a harm include its hardware, its software, its environment, and user input. There could be a different person behind each. The leading “robot operating software” is open source, meaning that there is not even a single author. Meanwhile, robot manufacturers will have relatively deep pockets and, given early use of robotics in areas like eldercare and autism research, plaintiffs will be understandably sympathetic.
Privacy: Robots are essentially a human instrument, and one of the chief uses to which we’ve put that instrument is surveillance. In addition to vastly increasing our power to observe, however, robots have the potential to open new pathways for government and hackers to access the home. Finally, robots have a social meaning that most machines lack. We tend to treat them as though a person were really present, including by experiencing the feeling of being observed and evaluated. It also reveals more about us how we interact with robots in a way it does not with other appliances. For those who are interested, I’ve written a book chapter on this topic, forthcoming from MIT Press and available on SSRN.
Labor law: My colleague Dan Siciliano made an interesting observation to me recently in private conversation. He speculated that were even one job at a fast food chain replaced by a robot—easy enough to imagine—the resulting shift from payroll to capital expenditure could upset an entire state program that depends on payroll tax. For now the model that has emerged out of auto factories, where replacing humans with robots is common, has largely sufficed. But this dynamic may play out differently in new contexts or at larger scales.
DC: Can law address them adequately?
RC: In some cases I think the answer is clearly yes. We can pass laws prohibiting certain uses of robots in warfare or immunizing manufacturers for some of the uses to which consumers put their products. In others, I’m skeptical. Take the third way robots implicate privacy, i.e., through their unique social meaning. If it turns out robots exert a subtle chill on expression, interrupt solitude, or persuade especially efficiently, the law will not be well-positioned to react.
DC: Your remarks to the ABA Magazine suggested that you would like to protect this emerging industry in much the way that law protected industry at the inception of the Industrial Revolution. Do you frame the issue this way or am I reading to much of Mort Horowitz’s Transformation of American Law into your comments?
RC: The short answer to your excellent question is that I’m not thinking on this grand a scale. I’m looking more toward the success of the reigning transformative technologies—computers and the Internet. (I’m not the only person to make this analogy: the name of the recent report to Congress by leading robotics institutions was titled “Roadmap: From Internet to Robotics.”). I believe we can promote the same success with robotics using a handful of statutory interventions; I don’t mean to endorse a sustained economic instrumentalism.
I believe that robotics holds enormous promise along many lines. There is evidence that programs like FIRST and Robogames are helping to promote interest in science, math, technology, and engineering (STEM), dangerously low among young Americans. As Ki Mae Huessner of ABC.com News points out, robots are capable of doing many of the tasks that humans risk their lives to do today. Her example is the recent mining accident; MIT is building a robot miner that could be operated from a safe position. I would add that robots have been used to address several high profile situations of late—a robot helped disassemble the Times Square bomb; robot submarines are involved in the Gulf Coast oil spill; etc. Remember too that the vast majority of car accidents are caused by human error.
I think that ultimately the most interesting uses of robotics will be determined by end-users—individual and corporate customers that modify robots in interesting ways and put them to novel uses. I worry that before we get there, however, there will be a high profile, high stakes accident involving a robot that—if handled the wrong way—will chill investment in, and diversity of, the American robotics industry. Other countries with higher bars to litigation and a greater acceptance of robots could then leap frog the United States with respect to the transformative technology of our time. We did this ourselves after all in the context of the Internet—as Eric Goldman has pointed out, it is no accident that Google, Yahoo!, Microsoft, etc., etc. all hail from the U.S.

Reports that the FCC may regulate broadband as a Title I service left some supporters of reclassification under Title II worried about the fate of net neutrality and the follow-through on some National Broadband Plan recommendations, they said at an event organized by Free Press. ""The Obama promise of keeping the Internet open and free is at stake,"" Marvin Ammori, Free Press senior adviser, said on a teleconference. After the Comcast decision, the FCC is left with two options, said Free Press Policy Counsel Aparna Sridhar: ""It can continue trying to shoehorn its policies into a Title I framework"" or classify data transmission under Title II.
... It would be a mistake to assume that the Title I route wouldn't cause litigation, but the question is how much, said Professor Barbara van Schewick of Stanford Law School.

89,"May 1, 2010",,,ABA Journal,"Ryan Calo, a residential fellow at the Center for Internet & Society, is quoted on robotics and liability issues. Richard Acello of the ABA Journal filed this story:
Robots may now be confined to sweeping living rooms and working assembly lines, but futurists and attorneys agree they are destined to take on a much greater role soon. Bill Gates has compared the development of robots to the earliest personal computers in the 1970s.
However, unlike that stationary pile of microchips on your desktop, robots have the potential to act in the real world. Attorneys and legal scholars are now puzzling over how harmful actions of robots will be assigned liability, and particularly how robotic maneuvers will fit into traditional legal concepts of responsibility and agency.
“Robots present a unique situation,” says Ryan Calo, a fellow at the Stanford Law School’s Center for Internet and Society. “Like the computer, it runs on software, but it can touch you. It doesn’t have a particular purpose like a lawn mower or a toaster; it’s more like a platform that you can program to do all kinds of different things. And it can act on the world, so it has legal repercussions. It might be very difficult to ascertain where the liability lies when a robot causes some physical harm.”
One possible avenue would be to view the robot as an agent of its owner, who would be presumed liable for the robot’s actions, but Calo says it’s not so simple. He has blogged about robotics and the law, and led a panel on the subject last year.
“Let’s say you rent a robot from the hospital to take care of Granny, and the neighborhood kids hack into the robot and it menaces Granny and she falls down the stairs. Who’s liable?” he asks. Possibilities include the hospital (which released it), the manufacturer (it’s easy to hack into), the neighborhood kids, or the consumer who failed to do something easy like update the software.
...
“Society tolerates Microsoft Word eating your thesis, but it won’t tolerate a robot running into somebody,” Calo says. “If you look at cases where computers have caused physical injury, then you could recover—for example, if the computer gave a cancer patient too much radiation.”
Calo favors limited immunity for the robot industry, similar to section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act, which gives “interactive computer services” immunity for information put on their sites.
“There is a real danger if there is complete legal uncertainty and you have a couple of bad incidents involving sympathetic plaintiffs,” Calo says. “That could put a chill on robot development.”
...
Dan Siciliano, faculty director of the corporate governance center at Stanford University, says robot law will most likely develop as an extension of traditional legal concepts. He expects plaintiffs lawyers will “name everybody” in the putative suit for damage caused by robots. “You will see liability work its way up the chain,” he says.

90,"April 29, 2010",,,The Microsoft Blog,"Professor Barbara van Schewick is quoted on net neutrality from a FCC workshop, where she served as an expert panelist:
Failure to regulate the Internet and preserve net neutrality would thwart innovation and endanger the already-fragile U.S. economy, several experts told the Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday. Unfortunately, a district court last week said the FCC doesn't have the power to prohibit Internet service providers from restricting access to specific websites, raising questions over the agency's ability to regulate the Internet. Now the FCC is trying to perhaps reclassify Internet-protocol (IP) communications as telecommunications, or find some other way around the ruling. ... During the FCC workshop, two areas of concern dominated the discussion. Comcast, for instance, restricted access to several websites, landing them in court to fight the FCC. And some ISPs would like to be able to charge Internet companies to gain access to users. ""It would allow them to pick winners and losers on the Internet,"" said panelist Barbara van Schewick, an assistant law professor at Stanford University. ""And there are a lot of problems with that.""

Who ever reads the user agreements?
As our lives have become more intertwined with the digital world, privacy advocates have become increasingly worried that we are often left with little other choice but to sign away any privacy concerns in the name of enjoying a fun or necessary service.
But a project at Stanford University is looking to change that with WhatApp.org, a Web forum where users can review and compare the privacy, security and openness of Internet and mobile applications.
The Web site grades applications on a five-point scale based on reviewers' answers to questions like: Can an application offer the same things without requesting so much information about the user? Or can users see and contribute to the source code?
...
""Consumers don't have a place where they can search for an app or compare them in the basis of values like security, privacy and openness. The idea is to kick the tires on these things and find out if some of these have security vulnerabilities,"" said Ryan Calo, a Stanford Law fellow and WhatApp's co-creator.
...
Calo views the project as a way to stimulate discussion about privacy and security. Bringing these values to the forefront will help encourage application developers to think more about them, he said.

92,"April 9, 2010",,,Miller-McCune,"Professor Barbara van Schewick talks to reporter Emily Badger about FCC Internet policy and net neutrality:
A federal appeals court in D.C. earlier this week threw up a roadblock to the Federal Communications Commission’s plans for the future of the Internet in America. The details of the case were relatively straight-forward: Comcast was caught interfering with traffic by customers using the cumbersome file-sharing application BitTorrent, flouting a 2005 FCC Internet policy stating that Web users are entitled to access the content and applications of their choice.
The FCC tried to sanction Comcast. Comcast sued. And on Tuesday — to the surprise of no one who has been following the case — the court ruled that the FCC doesn’t actually have the authority to enforce its Internet policy.
...
“A lot of what the FCC was trying to do, both with respect to net neutrality and to the broadband plan, is now in danger,” said Barbara van Schewick, director of Stanford Law School’s Center for Internet and Society. With two other professors and several advocacy groups, van Schewick filed a 2007 petition alongside the initial complaint against Comcast urging the FCC to clarify its Internet policy (and, more specifically, that Comcast’s behavior constituted a violation of it).
“Moving forward without clear authority would be a gamble — every single time the FCC wanted to do something regarding the Internet, it would have to go to court and show that it has ancillary jurisdiction,” she said, referring to the legal test the FCC failed this week. “And that has just become a lot more difficult.”
...
“It’s also the option the network providers hate most,” van Schewick explained. “They have already started to frame this as a bad option, saying, ‘The FCC will try to regulate Internet services like traditional telephony. This is heavy-handed regulation that is totally unsuitable.’”
...
If you can recall dial-up Internet days, van Schewick says, you may remember that you had any number of options for Internet service providers. The ISP sold by your telephone company was just one of them.
“Whereas today, where I live, the only choice I have is between the Comcast ISP service and the AT&T ISP service. There’s no independent option,” she said. “The only way to actually get this would be to force network providers to let independent ISPs on their network. This is a separate policy debate that’s really important.”
...
To take a step back: If the Internet today is not classified by the FCC in a way that treats it like a telecom service, what are we treating it like? The answer, van Schewick says, is that we treat the Internet like Facebook, or gmail, like an individual application.
...
“There is an important difference,” van Schewick suggested, “between the Internet as a general platform that is used by applications, and the applications themselves. The Internet is a basic infrastructure, like the electricity network, or the roads. We usually treat the electricity network different from toasters.”

CALO: There are countless examples of many different kinds of authorities using social networks in order to draw conclusions and sometimes to take adverse action.
Calo knows of cases in which school principals, employers, and law enforcement have used information from social networks against someone. And, of course, crooks can use that information to steal your identity. But what's possibly worse, Calo says, is that we don't really know how most of that information is being used.
CALO: What I lament about people living in public as much as they do is that we don’t appreciate the consequences of that, because we can’t even understand the many possible uses of our information.
LARRY DOWNES: Well, you know, I’m all for consentual, adult sharing of information. I think that's great.
Larry Downes is the author of Laws of Disruption: Harnessing the New Forces That Govern Business and Life in the Digital Age. He sees two forces in American culture that are coming head to head in these discussions about privacy.
DOWNES: We were founded by people who wanted to get away from government and wanted to get away from institutions that were suppressing them, so we have a sort of individualistic culture, and that leads us to be very protective of our privacy on the one hand. On the other hand, we have this idea of the free market, of capitalism, and of government not interfering with our commercial activities.
Downes acknowledges that as companies test the waters, there will be bumps in the road, as there were with Google and Facebook. But Downes says regulation is not the way to keep the information marketplace from going too far.
DOWNES: The general rule we’ve got under a capitalist system is that markets regulate themselves, and we know of course they don’t always do a perfect job, and we know of lots of places where they are broken and where it is appropriate for government to intervene. But the general rule is they will do a more efficient job of regulating themselves than the cost of external regulation.

On the Internet, things get old fast. One prime candidate for the digital dustbin, it seems, is the current approach to protecting privacy on the Internet.
It is an artifact of the 1990s, intended as a light-touch policy to nurture innovation in an emerging industry. And its central concept is “notice and choice,” in which Web sites post notices of their privacy policies and users can then make choices about sites they frequent and the levels of privacy they prefer.
But policy and privacy experts agree that the relentless rise of Internet data harvesting has overrun the old approach of using lengthy written notices to safeguard privacy.

M. Ryan Calo, a fellow at the Center for Internet and Society at the Stanford Law School, is exploring technologies that deliver “visceral notice.” His research involves voice and animation technology that emulates humans. When putting information in a personal health record, for example, a virtual nurse could explain to the user the privacy implications, and trade-offs, of sharing personal information with doctors, family members, insurers and drug companies.
Mr. Calo explains that people naturally react more strongly, in a visceral way, to anthropomorphic cues. He points to a sociological experiment that had people pay for coffee on an honor system. One box for depositing cash had a picture of flowers on it, while another had a picture of human eyes.

Attorneys for a San Francisco man are trying to set a legal precedent that would force police to obtain a search warrant before going through the cell phone of a person who has been arrested.
The issue is a highly contested one because technology has made it possible to carry a wide array of personal information on phones, including photos, e-mail messages and documents such as tax returns, attorneys said.
Under current state law, police can search cell phones at the time they arrest someone. However, privacy advocates say that is a violation of a person's Fourth Amendment rights, which guard against unreasonable search and seizure.
A San Mateo County Superior Court judge will consider the issue at a hearing Thursday. A separate but similar case is currently before the California Supreme Court.
...
This case and others like it shine a light on the legal effects of a technological revolution. When search and seizure rules were formulated, devices such as the iPhone didn't exist. Now that they are here, the judicial system has to catch up, said Ryan Calo, a residential fellow at the Stanford University Center for Internet and Society.
""Similar questions are popping up all over the place,"" he added.
Police are allowed to search a person in order to keep that person from destroying evidence or bringing contraband into a jail, he noted. They can seize a phone as well, but they should turn the phone off and wait for a warrant before searching it, Calo said.
One of those cases is before the California Supreme Court, and it involves a man convicted in 2008 of selling Ecstasy pills to an undercover officer in Thousand Oaks.

102,"February 16, 2010",,,CNN Tech,"Ryan Calo, a residential fellow at the Center for Internet & Society, is quoted on a student's constitutional right to criticize her teacher on Facebook. Rich Phillips of CNN reports:
A former Florida high school student who was suspended by her principal after she set up a Facebook page to criticize her teacher is protected constitutionally under the First Amendment, a federal magistrate ruled.
U.S. Magistrate Barry Garber's ruling, in a case viewed as important by Internet watchers, denied the principal's motion to dismiss the case and allows a lawsuit by the student to move forward.
""We have constitutional values that will always need to be redefined due to changes in technology and society,"" said Ryan Calo, an attorney with Stanford Law School's Center for Internet and Society.
""The fact that students communicate on a semi-public platform creates new constitutional issues and the courts are sorting them out,"" Calo said.
...
""It reassures Internet users and students that they can still speak their mind,"" Calo said. ""Its not a security issue. Its personal opinion and gossip.""
Calo believes high-profile campus shootings at Columbine and Virginia Tech have made schools more security conscious. But in this case, the principal went too far, he said.
""I think this is just an example of an overreaction on the part of an administrator to speech outside the classroom,"" he said.
""It used to be that principals wouldn't hear you talking about teachers outside the class. Social networks give principals the ability to see what students are saying about teachers and each other.
""It's one thing to use that information to identify illegal or dangerous conduct. It's quite another to punish opinion and speech outside the classroom that doesn't disrupt the activities of the classroom,"" he told CNN.

103,"February 16, 2010",,,CIO Today,"Ryan Calo, a residential fellow at the Center for Internet & Society, is quoted in CIO Today about the online privacy of Google users with regards to Google's launch of Buzz, it's social-media network:
Google's Todd Jackson has apologized for the Google Buzz fiasco in which Gmail users contacts were made public without notice. In response to user complaints, Google has further tweaked Google Buzz so matchups and sharing are no longer automatic. A security lab reported that in just two days, a Google Buzz spammer had linked to 237 people.
Google's effort to launch a social-media network on top of its existing 143 million Gmail users had a rough first week. Within days of last week's launch of Google Buzz, it was hard to keep up with users' privacy complaints and the company's rapid responses. Being automatically linked to contacts was a nonstarter. So was having those contacts revealed to other Gmail users.
So as the Mountain View, Calif.-based search giant looked ahead at how to make Buzz more marketable, company executives also looked back, admitting it might not have been a good idea to beta-test the system only with Google employees.
...
Ryan Calo, a residential fellow at the Center for the Internet and Society at Stanford University Law School, said the user revolt against Buzz's default privacy settings reinforced the notion that even in an age of exploding blog and social-media use, Internet users are still protective of their privacy.
""I wish Google had anticipated these privacy issues in advance and built them into the user experience from the beginning,"" said Calo. ""But I think there's good news in here for privacy advocates, too, namely that users care enough to object to sharing their information by default, and that a company like Google responds quickly.""

This spring, a project under development to help assess the security and privacy of software applications will go public. WhatApp, an online resource where experts and the public alike can rate applications based on how well-behaved they are, will help consumers to exercise their privacy rights, said its project manager.
The WhatApp service is being proposed as a Consumer Reports-style resource for software. Developed by the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford, it will cover downloadable desktop software, in addition to software for mobile phones, and online applications for social services such as Facebook and Friendster.
""It focuses specifically on privacy, security, and openness,"" said Ryan Calo, project manager for the service. ""Experts will be able to rate and review applications, so that individuals can get greater information about things before they download them, and make comparisons.""
...
""In addition to this, there are developer's notes, which is where the developer gets to brag about anything good that they've done with the application related to security and privacy,"" Calo added.

107,"January 11, 2010",,,Los Angeles Times,"Center for Internet Fellow Ryan Calo talked to the LA Times' DeeDee Correll about the role of Craigslist in a criminal case involving Jebidiah James Stipe, a Marine stationed at Twentynine Palms, California who is a accused of using the free online advertising service to arrange the rape of his former girlfriend:
A Wyoming man is accused of posing online as his former girlfriend and soliciting someone to act out a violent sexual fantasy.
...
The advertisement appeared on Craigslist in early December.
One week later, a man accepted the offer, forcing his way into the woman's home, tying her up and raping her at knifepoint.
...
Federal law protects Internet sites from liability for their users' actions, said M. Ryan Calo, residential fellow at Stanford Law School's Center for Internet and Society.
""The idea was that these website platforms were truly communities assembled of random users, with no editorial control over what users were doing. Craigslist is like a hotel with millions of rooms, but it doesn't have the ability to figure out what's happening in those rooms,"" Calo said.
A crime committed through a social networking site is no different than one perpetrated through a newspaper's printed classifieds, he said. Yet Internet-based crimes do make it easier for police to track down suspects because they leave a cyber-trail, Calo said.

109,"December 20, 2011",,,Bank Technology News,"Bank Technology News reports on Prof. van Schewick's recent letter to the FCC.
A Stanford University professor has filed a letter with the Federal Communications Commission urging it to investigate Verizon Wireless's blocking of Google Wallet on its new smart phone.
 
Barbara van Schewick, a professor of law and electrical engineering, said in the letter dated Monday that Verizon had violated ""open-devices and open-applications conditions in its legal licenses"" for part of the spectrum over which its LTE network operates. These conditions forbid the mobile company from blocking applications or devices.
 
Van Schewick asked the FCC to ""investigate the situation as quickly as possible and to send a signal to the market"" that ""openness conditions will be enforced."" She said that Verizon's actions hurt its consumers, competition and innovation.
 
Van Schewick also noted that Verizon ""has an incentive to undermine competition in mobile payments, and to eliminate any competitor's first-mover advantage."" Verizon has partnered with other mobile providers to launch a competing payment service.
 
Verizon's new Galaxy Nexus phone went on sale on Thursday. Last week Free Press, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit, filed its own objection with the FCC.
 
To block Google Wallet, Verizon is making it impossible for the mobile payment application to access the ""secure element"" in its smart phone, van Schewick said. A user's credit card information is stored on this chip separate from the phone's operating system and hardware.
 
Van Schewick has previously written to the FCC about Verizon. In June, she filed a letter asking the commission to investigate Verizon's blocking of tethering applications for public comment.

Internet surfers have long worried that they have insufficient control over their online privacy — despite the privacy policies many people agree to when they visit websites or use online services.
 
There are data to support the surfers' feelings: Online privacy policies are so cumbersome and onerous that it would take the average person about 250 working hours every year — about 30 full working days — to actually read the privacy policies of the websites they visit in a year, according to an analysis by researchers Aleecia M. McDonald and Lorrie Faith Cranor.

Of the three panels, one is devoted to privacy and another to copyright. The third is devoted to a long, ambitious law review article ... written by me. The panel participants joining me to discuss the article are two of the nation's great free speech scholars--Harvard's Yochai Benkler and the University of Virginia's Lillian BeVier. The article is called First Amendment Architecture. In it, I argue that the First Amendment plays an important role in ensuring adequate physical and digital spaces for speech, and that this role is not some exceptional outgrowth of First Amendment doctrine but is central to understanding what the First Amendment ""means."" While I submitted the paper for publication in February 2011, the subsequent events of the Arab Spring, the Occupy Movement, and the fight over SOPA/PIPA have all highlighted the significance to democratic speech of open physical and digital spaces.

In the wake of the Stop Online Piracy Act/PROTECT IP Act (collectively, SOPA) Web protest, some commentators have pointed out that Anti Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) is even worse in both substance and procedure.  The secretive process through which ACTA was negotiated is now well known, at least amongst those paying attention.  Indeed, the very secrecy of the process has made paying attention both difficult to do and critically important, as ACTA seeks to create a new international framework for combating piracy.  SOPA, in a profound way, has shown the value of transparency, albeit imperfect, when lawmakers are faced with pervasive and poorly understood technology like the Internet, and a new problem of scale like the distribution of intellectual property (IP) on the borderless Internet.  The public’s access to actual texts of SOPA, combined with a relatively simple process for offering actual input about the bills, will hopefully create better law by allowing knowledgeable parties to explain technologies that are not well understood.  No such opportunity existed with ACTA.

Danielle Citron's post:
 
Mr. Wolf astutely observes that anonymity online can unlock people’s rage. Why not vent bigotry, spread lies or threaten others if no one can identify us to hold us accountable?
 
Intermediaries’ insistence that users employ their real names might stem the tide of incivility and hate online. But its costs may not outweigh its benefits. Without anonymity, victims of domestic violence and sexual assault might not join online survivors groups for fear that their abusers might discover them.
 
Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender teenagers might decline to seek advice about coping with bullying. Blogging may be less attractive to women; writing under female names raises one’s risk of cyberharassment.
 
Rather than a mandatory real-name policy, intermediaries ought to adopt anonymity as their default setting, a privilege that can be lost by harming others in ways that intermediaries find unacceptable. That preserves anonymity’s upside potential and potentially forestalls its downside.

The shooting of an unarmed black teenager in Florida has sparked heated reactions across the country, but there was a lag before mainstream media picked up on the story. Not so online, where a more immediate outcry grew into a petition drive this week to encourage a federal investigation.
Now the Justice Department is looking into Trayvon Martin's death at the hands of a neighborhood watch volunteer, and black media and social media were key in demanding closer scrutiny.
 
The 17-year-old was shot on Feb. 26, but it was the release Friday of 911 tapes from the night of his death that made the case a top story in the mainstream media — and kept it there.
 
In calls to dispatchers, witnesses reported gunshots and screaming. By the end of the evening, Martin was dead, allegedly shot in the chest by George Zimmerman, who had told the dispatcher moments before that Martin looked ""suspicious.""

Earlier this year, the Supreme Court said police had overstepped their legal authority by planting a GPS tracker on the car of a suspected drug dealer without getting a search warrant. It seemed like another instance in a long line of cases that test the balance between personal privacy and the needs of law enforcement.
 
But the decision in U.S. v. Jones set off alarm bells inside the FBI, where officials are trying to figure out whether they need to change the way they do business.
 
Before the Supreme Court ruling in late January, the FBI had about 3,000 GPS tracking devices in the field.
 
Government lawyers scrambled to get search warrants for weeks before the decision, working to convince judges they had probable cause to believe crimes were taking place.
 
But after the ruling, FBI officials tell NPR, agents still had to turn off 250 devices that they couldn't turn back on.

Marketplace Tech interviews CIS Executive Director of the Fair Use Project Anthony Falzone about Google file sharing. 
If you’re an online company, it’s certainly good to have a friend in Google. That’s where Hotfile finds itself now as the search giant has filed as a friend of the court brief in the ongoing legal action between Hotfile and the Motion Picture Association of America. The MPAA wants Hotfile shut down because, it claims, Hotfile is trafficking in pirated content like movies and TV shows.
 
But Google has stepped in, filing a brief with the court that Hotfile shouldn’t be held accountable for what people do on the site, just as Google shouldn’t be held accountable for what people put on YouTube, which Google owns.
 
Eric Goldman from Santa Clara University Law School says under current law it’s up to whoever owns the copyright to file a complaint that their work is appearing illegally. “When a service provider gets a notice like that,” he says, “they can ignore the notice and take whatever legal consequence might flow from that, or they can expeditiously respond to the notice in which case the law is designed to give them a safe harbor that says they're no longer liable.”
 
The safe harbor provision affords greater creativity among entrepreneurs because they’re not as worried about what content might pass through their servers. “The point of this safe harbor protection in particular was to provide certainty for people who wanted to create new platforms for sharing information online,” says Stanford Law lecturer Anthony Falzone, who is concerned some of these cases will have a chilling effect and stop the next YouTube or Facebook from being developed.

If you want to become a state trooper in Virginia, you should probably delete any indelicate information you have on Facebook. During the job interview process, the Virginia State Police requires all applicants to sign into Facebook, Twitter, and any social-networking site to which they regularly post information in front of an administrator.
“You sign a waiver, then there’s a laptop and you go to these sites and your interviewer reviews your information,” says Corinne Geller, spokeswoman for the Virginia State Police. “It’s a virtual character check as much as the rest of the process is a physical background check.” Geller says the practice has been around for only three months and is just one of many ways the state makes sure its law enforcement officials are ethically sound. (Potential troopers also have to submit to a polygraph test).

Attribution issues may come up in situations of plagiarism, but they have little do with copyright infringement, which is infringement with or without attribution. Elsewhere, there are issues of moral rights, but for the most part, the US does not recognize moral rights in copyright. Of course, many have argued that perhaps attribution is more important than much of what is in copyright law, and at times there have been efforts to focus more on the question of attribution over infringement. A recent study has tried to quantify some issues around this idea and put questions about the value of attribution into context.

Days after anti-piracy legislation stalled in Congress, the U.S. Department of Justice coordinated an unprecedented raid on the Hong Kong-based website Megaupload.com. New Zealand law enforcement agents swooped in by helicopter to arrest founder Kim Dotcom at his home outside of Auckland, and seized millions of dollars worth of art, vehicles and real estate. Six other Megaupload employees were also arrested. Meanwhile, the Justice Department seized Megaupload's domain names and the data of at least 50 million users worldwide.
 
What did Megaupload do to attract a response normally reserved for drug cartels and terrorists? Depending on whom you ask, it was either a cyberlocker that allowed users to store, share and retrieve any manner of data, or a vast conspiracy to facilitate piracy on a worldwide scale. The government's indictment against Megaupload and its principals is premised on several aggressive extensions of copyright law that will make it even harder to identify the line between legitimate hosting services and criminal conduct, while its data seizure leaves millions of users wondering what the government is going to do with their information and whether they will ever get it back.
 
In some respects, Megaupload was like many other companies that let people store files in the ""cloud."" It permitted its users to upload a file, and then provided a URL that allowed that user (or anyone else who knew the URL) to access and download the file from any computer connected to the Internet. Any user could upload files up to 2 GB in size and store a total of 200 GB for free. Premium account holders enjoyed unlimited file size and storage capacity, and substantially faster downloading speeds. These large storage limits and fast upload/download speeds made Megaupload an especially attractive platform for users who worked with large audio and video files. Musicians and software developers used Megaupload to collaborate and to distribute their work, and many others used it to store a wide range of legitimate content like digital photographs, and audio and video files.
 
The same features that made Megaupload attractive to legitimate users also made it attractive to people who wanted to share copyrighted content without permission. Some of the site's features seemed calculated to exploit that fact. For instance, Megaupload provided financial rewards to users who uploaded popular files. Arguably, this created an incentive for users to upload copyrighted content and distribute the URL widely. Indeed, the government's indictment alleges that one user received more than $55,000 in rewards. In order to monetize download traffic, the company ran advertisements on each download page. It also created another site called Megavideo, which allowed individuals to stream video content directly, or through another site. In either case, the video content was accompanied by advertising served by yet another entity called Megaclick. As a result, the more popular the files were, the more Megaupload earned from subscription fees and advertising.
 
The grand jury indictment against Megaupload and its principals alleges they were part of a ""mega conspiracy"" - ""a worldwide criminal organization ... engaged in copyright infringement and money laundering on a massive scale."" Some of the accusations in the indictment are straightforward. For instance, Megaupload employees allegedly uploaded prerelease movies to the site, including the film ""Taken,"" knowing these uploads were improper. These direct infringements would be clear violations of criminal copyright law. But the heart of the government's case seeks to impose substantial criminal liability for acts of infringement committed by Megaupload users, not the defendants themselves. In doing so, the indictment pushes several aspects of copyright law well past existing boundaries.
 
The Copyright Act prohibits specific acts of infringement, e.g., reproduction, distribution, public performance and preparation of derivative works. 17 U.S.C. Section 106. Committing these acts becomes a criminal offense if the infringement is willful, and is committed for commercial advantage or financial gain, involves works with a retail value of more than $1000, or prerelease movies or music. 17 U.S.C. Section 506(a)(1); 18 U.S.C. Section 2319. The Copyright Act does not specify any circumstances in which one party is liable for the infringing acts of another. While copyright law has long imposed ""secondary liability"" on one party for the infringing acts of another, that doctrine is a function of judge-made, not statutory, law.
 
In general, a party with control over the direct infringer who fails to stop the infringement, or who knows of the infringement and makes a material contribution to it is secondarily liable. Copyright owners have long argued that companies who supply technology that facilitates both legal and illegal copying are liable for the unlawful acts of their customers.
 
The Supreme Court addressed that question in 1984, in Sony v. Universal Studios. In that case, copyright owners contended that a manufacturer of video cassette recorders was liable for infringement based on copies of television shows and sporting events its customers made using the device. The Court rejected that argument, holding that suppliers of technology are not secondarily liable for users' infringement if the device in question is capable of substantial non-infringing uses.
 
The Supreme Court narrowed this rule in 2005 when it decided MGM Studios v. Grokster. In that case, the Court held a defendant providing Internet file-sharing services capable of substantial non-infringing use was nevertheless liable for unlawful copies made by its users where the evidence showed that the company intended to, and took affirmative steps to, induce the infringing conduct.
 
Cyberlocker services are plainly capable of substantial non-infringing uses; for example, they allow musicians and filmmakers to collaborate on and share their works. The government's indictment, however, lays out a case of inducement underGrokster, pointing to emails and other evidence that the principals knew and encouraged infringement by employees and users alike. The interesting question is whether a judge-crafted theory of civil liability developed in 2005 is sufficient to impose criminal liability. No court has decided that issue, but it is presently before the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Puerto 80 Projects v. USA. In that case, Puerto 80 is challenging the seizure of its rojadirecta.com and other domain names based on the fact its sites linked to infringing content.
 
Puerto 80's lawyers have challenged the government's assertion that criminal liability can be based on judge-made secondary infringement liability theories, including Grokster-style inducement. Specifically, they point out that Congress considered and rejected proposed statutes that would have created such liability so the current doctrine must not include criminal inducement liability. To rule otherwise, they contend, would create criminal liability in vague and uncertain circumstances, violating due process of law.

And you’re complicit in helping them do so. By keeping your phone on — and who doesn’t do that, except, of course, on airplanes? — you are letting any number of people and places have access to private information about you that you might not think you’re giving out.
 
Sometimes you’re putting the information into pretty packages by signing into sites like Foursquare, which is linked to your Facebook account, when you enter a restaurant, a bar, even a church.
 
“Location information can reveal a great deal about a person,” said Catherine Crump, staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Unions.

“Essentially, they are looking at online dispute resolution [ODR],” said Timothy Lemay, principal legal officer with the UNCITRAL Secretariat in Vienna. “The concern is there are many, many millions of cross-border but small transactions. There is no very good place for those disputes to be resolved.”

Honing in on the heavily opposed Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and Protect IP Act (PIPA), which failed in the U.S. Senate and House, respectively, Issa discussed the need for unambiguous laws in this domain.
Issa, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, weighed in on SOPA and PIPA, both of which he vocally opposed.

312,"April 10, 2012",,,Vermont Public Radio,"CIS Student Fellow Jonathan Mayer interviewed in this Vermont Public Radio story about the Do Not Track browser option that is gaining popularity. 
Government regulators in the U.S. and Europe are putting pressure on the online advertising industry to adopt a new Web browser option called ""do not track."" The option is designed to let people request more privacy from the websites they visit.
But there's no consensus yet on how much privacy users should expect. An Internet industry task force convenes Tuesday in Washington to try to hash that out.
Some browsers, like Internet Explorer, Safari and Firefox, already come with a ""do not track"" button. Other browsers are expected to add the feature soon.
 
Jonathan Mayer, a Stanford graduate student specializing in computer science and law, has helped to popularize the concept. He says more than 10 million Internet users are already using the option. It sends a signal to websites and online advertisers that a user does not want his or her browsing behavior tracked.

Online companies on Thursday reached broad agreements with privacy activists and government regulators on limiting collection of customer information. But sharp differences remain between U.S. regulators–who have sided with privacy advocates–and corporations.
 
The purpose of the three day meeting in Washington, D.C., organized by the standard setting World Wide Web Consortium, was to help establish a Do-Not-Track button that would allow consumers to prevent marketers from monitoring their online activities. The meeting occurred less than two months after Obama administration presented a “Privacy Bill of Rights,” which would include a Do-Not-Track rule. And companies hope the Do-Not-Track mechanism will satisfy European Union privacy laws set to come into effect this summer.
 
Corporations, regulators and advocates, all of whom attended the meeting, agreed that businesses should be allowed to record information taken from of their own customers, even if those users opted out. And companies agreed with privacy advocates that advertisers should not be allowed to collect most data on opted-out customers passing through a site, according to participants and documents created at the meeting.
 
“Everyone agrees on the principles here,” Aleecia McDonald, co-chair of the Do-Not-Track  committee hosted by W3C,. “Where we disagree are on the mechanics.”

New white paper by leading net neutrality scholar discusses the Federal Communications Commission’s Open Internet rules and the relationship between network neutrality and Quality of Service
 

STANFORD, Calif., June 11, 2012 –Barbara van Schewick, faculty director of the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School and a professor of law and electrical engineering at Stanford University, today published a white paper titled “Network Neutrality and Quality of Service: What a Non-Discrimination Rule Should Look Like.” Currently, the relationship between network neutrality and Quality of Service is uncertain and contentious. Often, it is not immediately apparent how a specific non-discrimination rule affects network providers’ ability to offer Quality of Service. At the same time, it is unclear which forms of Quality of Service, if any, a network neutrality regime should allow. The paper explains how eight different non-discrimination rules affect network providers’ ability to offer Quality of Service and which forms of Quality of Service, if any, a non-discrimination rule should allow.
 
The paper:
Provides the first detailed analysis of the FCC’s non-discrimination rule and of its implications for network providers’ ability to manage their networks and offer Quality of Service;
Offers the first in-depth analysis of the relationship between network neutrality and Quality of Service; and
Proposes a non-discrimination rule that policy makers should adopt around the world – a rule that the FCC adopted at least in part.
 
The paper is particularly timely. This month, the FCC announced the members of its Open Internet Advisory Committee, and, whether the FCC wins or loses the legal appeal of the Open Internet order, the question of which, if any, network-discriminations require legal action will remain relevant for years to come in the U.S. In addition, across the Atlantic, the group of European Regulators for Electronic Communication Networks and Services (BEREC) started a consultation in June focused on various aspects of the relationship between network neutrality and Quality of Service – the very topics rigorously addressed in this White Paper. 
 
According to Professor Barbara van Schewick:
“Many network neutrality proponents were disappointed by the FCC’s Open Internet rules. While they are not perfect, they provide the FCC with a powerful set of tools to protect users and innovators against discrimination by providers of Internet service. In addition, the FCC can rely on the network neutrality conditions governing the C-Block of the 700 MHz Band, purchased by Verizon Wireless, and those in the Comcast-NBC merger agreement – if the FCC were interested in using these tools.” 
 
“The network neutrality debate is often framed as a debate for or against Quality of Service. The reality is much more nuanced. Many network neutrality proposals allow some, but not all forms of Quality of Service. Many forms of Quality of Service allow Internet service providers to distort competition among applications and interfere with user choice. These forms of Quality of Service should be banned. However, some forms of user-controlled Quality of Service do not similarly threaten application innovation, competition or user choice. They provide the social benefits of different types of service without the social costs. These forms of Quality of Service are the ones a network neutrality regime should allow. Thus, it is possible to protect users and innovators while allowing the network to evolve. Regulators can have their cake and eat it, too.”

The Supreme Court will soon hear a case that will affect whether you can sell your iPad -- or almost anything else -- without needing to get permission from a dozen ""copyright holders."" Here are some things you might have recently done that will be rendered illegal if the Supreme Court upholds the lower court decision:
1. Sold your first-generation iPad on Craigslist to a willing buyer, even if you bought the iPad lawfully at the Apple Store.
 
2. Sold your dad's used Omega watch on eBay to buy him a fancier (used or new) Rolex at a local jewelry store.
 
3. Sold an ""import CD"" of your favorite band that was only released abroad but legally purchased there. Ditto for a copy of a French or Spanish novel not released in the U.S.
 
4. Sold your house to a willing buyer, so long as you sell your house along with the fixtures manufactured in China, a chandelier made in Thailand or Paris, support beams produced in Canada that carry the imprint of a copyrighted logo, or a bricks or a marble countertop made in Italy with any copyrighted features or insignia.

The human operators who control America’s killer drones are susceptible to the same psychological stress that infantrymen sometimes experience after combat. But better drones and control systems could help reduce the controllers’ stress levels — by allowing the people to blame the robots for the awful human cost of remote air strikes.
 
But there’s a downside. Sometimes you don’t want drone operators avoiding feelings of guilt.
 
At least that’s what Stanford University researcher Ryan Calo has concluded. Calo, one of the country’s top experts on the legal and ethical aspects of robot technology, has written extensively on the subject — and closely tracks the work of other researchers in his field. “It really matters how you design the controls,” Calo tells Danger Room. “Design and interface design … can change incentives and can change the psychological impact.”

While there are many subtle variations of net neutrality, the concept as a whole comes from the idea that the Internet should have a “soft middle” that exerts little or no influence over the behavior of users and applications, and a very robust set of services at the edge that handle all the problems of congestion, charging, and innovation. This distinction is the point of the “end-to-end arguments” that seek to encourage designers of distributed systems to build vague and general systems in which all application-specific features are added as late as possible to the design. If elections were structured according the end-to-end arguments, there would not be any primaries, voters would simply select from a list of 50 candidates in the general (perhaps using some form of multiple-choice voting.)

If Mayer’s instinct was right, advertisers were eying people as they moved from one website to another even though their browsers were configured to prevent this sort of digital shadowing. Working long hours at his office, Mayer ran a series of clever tests in which he purchased ads that acted as sniffers for the sort of unauthorized cookies he was looking for. He hit the jackpot, unearthing one of the biggest privacy scandals of the past year: Google was secretly planting cookies on a vast number of iPhone browsers. Mayer thinks millions of iPhones were targeted by Google.

Google has been hit with the biggest fine in the history of the Federal Trade Commission: $22.5 million. It has to do with cookies, bits of computer code placed on your browser when you visit a website.
Jonathan Mayer is the Stanford grad student who brought Google's practices to light, which led to the fine. He says, ""Google was setting cookies in Safari web browsers associated with their advertising service, ""Double Click."" And they'd made a representation on their website that, if you were a Safari user, you wouldn't be tracked by Google. So they breached that representation.""
 
The Safari browser is made by Apple.
 
Ryan Calo, law professor at the University of Washington, says in the end the case against Google was pretty simple. ""No one knows for sure whether or not Google was doing this on purpose with full knowledge or whether it was an accident. Either way, it doesn't really much matter from the Federal Trade Commission's perspective. Because all it cares about is the fact that Google had said that it was not doing this activity.

Like any incident involving an alleged criminal act, we need to consider an entire host of factors. Let's take a deeper look and find out who should pay when your robot breaks the law.

Not legally speaking, autonomous cars are those which can drive themselves without any human input, and partly (or mostly) autonomous cars have reduced human input. They use sensors to provide electronic input to a rapidly interpreting computer, and the computer controls some or all of the car’s control mechanisms. There is a spectrum of automation: some commercially available cars offer semiautonomous parallel parking, others can keep a deemed safe distance behind the car in front, and the most advanced research and development (R&D) cars can drive across vast systems of roads without any notable human intervention. However, driving in “critical” situations, such as in extremely busy downtown streets with very high numbers of dynamic objects (bikers, pedestrians, other vehicles), has overwhelmed even the leading R&D autonomous cars’ computational systems, requiring human intervention. Power steering and anti-lock braking systems are early forms of automation.

515,"December 3, 2012",,,SLS News,"Cross-posted from SLS News.
STANFORD, Calif., December 3, 2012— Stanford Law School today announced the appointment of Aleecia M. McDonald as Director of Privacy at the Center for Internet and Society (CIS). McDonald will lead the Center’s work at the intersection of online technologies, privacy, and policy, with a particular focus on: user expression of Internet privacy preferences including Do Not Track, a technology and policy proposal that enables Internet users to opt out of tracking by websites; self-help measures and privacy enhancing technologies; mobile privacy challenges; and global frameworks for privacy rights.
 
McDonald was most recently a resident fellow at CIS. Prior to that, she was a senior privacy researcher at Mozilla, where she worked on their Do Not Track web browser feature, as well as co-chair of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Tracking Protection Working Group. Her academic research areas include user expectations for Do Not Track, mobile privacy notices, behavioral economics and mental models of privacy, and the efficacy of industry self-regulation. McDonald has a decade of experience working for software startups and earned a PhD in Engineering & Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University, where she studied online privacy as a member of the CyLab Usable Privacy and Security Laboratory.
 
The Center for Internet and Society is a public interest technology law and policy program that studies the interaction of new technologies and the law and is a part of the Law, Science and Technology Program at Stanford Law School. Led by faculty director Barbara van Schewick, CIS strives to improve both technology and law, encouraging decision makers to design both as a means to further democratic values. Along with conducting research and policy analysis, the Center sponsors legal fellowships, organizes events to foster discussion of critical policy issues, and provides educational opportunities for law students to conduct applicable research and policy analysis in this field.
 
“Data privacy is reaching a critical level of public and regulatory interest. Current industry data practices face intense scrutiny from policy makers around the world.  The next few years are pivotal for Internet privacy,” said Barbara van Schewick, associate professor of law, Helen L. Crocker Faculty Scholar, and associate professor of electrical engineering (by courtesy). “Aleecia’s expertise in technology and public policy uniquely qualifies her to find solutions that effectively protect privacy. I am thrilled that she will lead our research in this field.”
 
“Privacy is a complex and nuanced topic, but one that affects our lives everyday,” McDonald said. “CIS is one of the few centers in the country that not only allows but nurtures interdisciplinary privacy work. I am very lucky to be able to call CIS my home as I work on fascinating topics that contribute meaningfully to policy dialogues — from qualitative and quantitative insights about user interactions to technical measurement of tracking techniques.”

STANFORD, Calif., August 20, 2013—Stanford Law School today announced that researchers at its Center for Internet and Society (CIS) have received a Frontier award as part of the National Science Foundation’s Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace project. The award amount is $3.75 million to support research on online privacy that will be conducted at Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, and Fordham over the next four years (2013-2017).
The project tackles the tough problem of online privacy notices. Many companies publish privacy policies that explain how they collect, use, and retain online data. But in practice, privacy policies are not very useful to people online. Privacy policies are hard to understand and take too long to read.
“We need a better way for people to get the information that matters most to them about online privacy,” said CIS Director of Privacy Aleecia M. McDonald, who will be overseeing the research conducted at Stanford Law School. “We know people don’t read privacy policies, even with serious and growing concerns about massive online data collection. You would need to be a lawyer and a technologist to understand what policies do say, as well as a privacy professional to notice what policies don’t say. That’s why we are taking an interdisciplinary approach with experts from three leading universities in all three fields.”
“We are excited to be part of this project,” said CIS Faculty Director Barbara van Schewick. “Our work will make it easier for Internet users to understand what happens to their data and will help them make more informed privacy decisions online.”
“Stanford Law School is committed to interdisciplinary learning and research and we are honored to receive this National Science Foundation award to further advance an emerging and exciting field of study,” said Stanford Law School Dean Elizabeth Magill.
The project will use machine learning to automate transforming privacy policies into readable formats, then use crowd sourcing for areas where machine learning runs into ambiguities. Ultimately, the researchers envision a browser plugin that can alert users to online practices that do not match their expectations and preferences. In addition to improving transparency online, researchers will have a database to query to understand how companies approach privacy, as well as what changes over time, which opens new avenues for public policy research.
About Aleecia M. McDonaldDr. Aleecia M. McDonald is the Director of Privacy at Stanford’s Center for Internet and Society. McDonald’s research includes behavioral economics and mental models of privacy and the efficacy of industry self-regulation. McDonald co-chaired, and remains active in, the WC3’s Tracking Protection Working Group, an ongoing effort to establish international standards for a Do Not Track mechanism that users can enable to request enhanced privacy online. This effort brings together more than 100 international stakeholders from industry, academia, civil society, privacy advocates, and regulators. The group is chartered to reach an open, consensus-based multi-party agreement that will establish a baseline for what sites must do when they comply with an incoming request for user privacy. McDonald’s decade of experience working in software startups adds a practical focus to her academic work, and she was a Senior Privacy Researcher for Mozilla (part-time, 2011-12.) She holds a PhD in Engineering & Public Policy from Carnegie Mellon.
About the Center for Internet and SocietyLed by Faculty Director Professor Barbara van Schewick, the Center for Internet and Society (CIS) is a public interest technology law and policy program at Stanford Law School and a part of the Law, Science and Technology Program. CIS brings together scholars, academics, legislators, students, programmers, security researchers, and scientists to study the interaction of new technologies and the law and to examine how the synergy between the two can either promote or harm public goods like free speech, innovation, privacy, public commons, diversity, and scientific inquiry. CIS strives to improve both technology and law, encouraging decision makers to design both as a means to further democratic values. CIS provides law students and the general public with educational resources and analyses of policy issues arising at the intersection of law, technology and the public interest.
About Barbara van SchewickBarbara van Schewick is an Associate Professor of Law and Helen L. Crocker Faculty Scholar at Stanford Law School, an Associate Professor (by courtesy) of Electrical Engineering in Stanford University’s Department of Electrical Engineering, and Faculty Director of Stanford Law School’s Center for Internet and Society.
Van Schewick’s research on the economic, regulatory, and strategic implications of communication networks bridges law, networking and economics. This work has made her a leading expert on network neutrality, perhaps the Internet’s most debated policy issue, which concerns Internet users’ ability to access the content and software of their choice without interference from network providers.
Her book Internet Architecture and Innovation (MIT Press 2010, Paperback 2012) is considered to be the seminal work on the science, economics and policy of network neutrality. Her papers on network neutrality have influenced regulatory debates in the United States, Canada and Europe. She has testified before the FCC in en banc hearings and official workshops. The Federal Communication Commission’s Open Internet Order, which was published in December 2010 and went into effect in November 2011, relied heavily on her work. In 2010, van Schewick received the Research Prize Technical Communication 2010 from the Alcatel-Lucent Stiftung for Communications Research for her pioneering work in the area of Internet architecture, innovation and regulation.
Van Schewick holds a PhD in Computer Science, an MSc in Computer Science, and a BSc in Computer Science, all summa cum laude from Technical University Berlin, the Second State Exam in Law (equivalent of Bar Exam), summa cum laude, from the Higher Regional Court Berlin and the First State Exam in Law (equivalent of J.D.), summa cum laude, from Free University Berlin.
About M. Elizabeth MagillMary Elizabeth Magill was appointed the Richard E. Lang Professor of Law and Dean of Stanford Law School on September 1, 2012. She is the law school’s 13th dean. Before coming to Stanford she was on the faculty at the University of Virginia School of Law for 15 years, serving most recently as vice dean, the Joseph Weintraub–Bank of America Distinguished Professor of Law, and the Elizabeth D. and Richard A. Merrill Professor.
An expert in administrative law and constitutional structure, Dean Magill teaches administrative law, constitutional law, and food and drug law. Her scholarly articles have been published in leading law reviews, and she has won several awards for her scholarly contributions. She is a member of the American Law Institute and served as a fellow in the Program in Law and Public Affairs at Princeton University, a visiting professor at Harvard Law School, and the Thomas Jefferson Visiting Fellow at Downing College, Cambridge University.
After completing her BA in history at Yale University in 1988, Dean Magill served as a senior legislative assistant for energy and natural resources for U.S. Senator Kent Conrad, a position she held for four years. She left the Hill to attend the University of Virginia School of Law, where she was articles development editor of the Virginia Law Review and received several awards for academic and scholarly achievement. After graduating in 1995, Dean Magill clerked for Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and then for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

The general value of commons as a resource management principle is that it maintains openness, does not discriminate among users or uses of the resource, and eliminates the need to obtain approval or a license to use the resource. As a general matter, managing infrastructure resources in an openly accessible manner eliminates the need to rely on either market actors or the government to “pick winners” downstream. In theory, at least, this facilitates innovation in the creation of and experimentation with new uses.

If one can’t easily prevent or monitor the sale of data, what sense does it make to carefully bargain for limits on its use by the original collector?

As they do so, they should carefully consider the insights of Professor Woody Hartzog.

While it sounds obscure, the movement for such reclassification has become something of a rallying cry among advocates of net neutrality, the idea that broadband companies must treat all Internet traffic equally. With reclassification, the providers would be subject to far greater regulation on everything from pricing to how they interconnect with other networks.
...
Stanford Law professor Barbara Van Schewick said the FCC can't ban paid deals without reclassifying broadband. If the agency chooses to follow Mr. Wheeler's plan, she said, it must allow broadband providers to strike the deals with content companies to enforce the no-blocking rule.

From its belly, a package comes tumbling downward, connected by a thin line to the vehicle itself. Right before the delivery hits the ground, it slows, hitting the earth with a tap. The delivery slows, almost imperceptibly, just before it hits the ground, hardly kicking up any dust. A small rectangular module on the end of the line detaches the payload, and ascends back up the vehicle, locking into place beneath the nose.

My book truly deals with actionable harassment, not abuse that cannot be regulated (often called “trolling,” a loose term). Consider one of the earliest cases, of game developer and blogger Kathy Sierra, where there are repeated credible threats of rape, doctored photographs of her being strangled, and lies about her. Then, a cybermob posted her Social Security number and home address, as well as defamatory lies about her. Whoever was responsible for those actions, even just some of them, would be treading on legal grounds –we can regulate true threats, defamation and certain privacy disclosures such as the disclosure of SSNs (which is like publishing your bank account number). To be sure, some of the folks who doxxed Sierra and published her SSN were self-proclaimed trolls, but nonetheless they engaged in unprotected activity by spreading defamatory lies and publishing her SSN.

1385,"March 29, 2015",,,Balkinization,"I have posted a draft of my latest essay, The Path of Robotics Law, on SSRN. Here is the abstract:
 
This essay, written as a response to Ryan Calo's valuable discussion in ""Robotics and the Lessons of Cyberlaw,"" describes key problems that robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) agents present for law.
 
The first problem is how to distribute rights and responsibilities among human beings when non-human agents create benefits like artistic works or cause harms like physical injuries. The difficulty is caused by the fact that the behavior of robotic and AI systems is ""emergent;"" their actions may not be predictable in advance or constrained by human expectations about proper behavior. Moreover,the programming and algorithms used by robots and AI entities may be the work of many hands, and may employ generative technologies that allow innovation at multiple layers. These features of robotics and AI enhance unpredictability and diffusion of causal responsibility for what robots and AI agents do. 
 
Lawrence Lessig’s famous dictum that “Code is Law” argued that combinations of computer hardware and software, like other modalities of regulation, could constrain and direct human behavior. Robotics and AI present the converse problem. Instead of code as a law that regulates humans, robotics and AI feature emergent behavior that escapes human planning and expectations. Code is lawless.
 
The second problem raised by robotics and AI is the ""substitution effect."" People will substitute robots and AI agents for living things—and especially for humans. But they will do so only in certain ways and only for certain purposes. In other words, people tend to treat robots and AI agents as special-purpose animals or special-purpose human beings. This substitution is likely to be incomplete, contextual, unstable, and often opportunistic. People may treat the robot as a person (or animal) for some purposes and as an object for others. The problem of substitution touches many different areas of law, and it promises to confound us for a very long time.
 
Finally, the essay responds to Calo's argument about the lessons of cyberlaw for robotics. Calo argues that lawyers should identify the “essential characteristics” of robotics and then ask how the law should respond to the problems posed by those essential characteristics. I see the lessons of cyberlaw quite differently. We should not think of essential characteristics of technology independent of how people use technology in their lives and in their social relations with others. Because the use of technology in social life evolves, and because people continually find new ways to employ technology for good or for ill, it may be unhelpful to freeze certain features of use at a particular moment and label them “essential characteristics.” Innovation in technology is not just innovation of tools and techniques; it may also involve innovation of economic, social and legal relations. As we innovate socially and economically, what appears most salient and important about our technologies may also change.

In response to China’s question, a number of security experts have pointed to the danger of mass attack by conventional weapons on strategically important installations.  Autonomous weapons would open new modes for such attacks, and would heighten the risk of preemptive attacks up to and including nuclear weapons.
I would like comment on the survey results presented by Professor Horowitz, and the conclusions he asks us to draw from them.
You are correct that public opinion is not equivalent to public conscience. Unfortunately, we know all too well that the desires of the majority can often result in the injustices towards a minority. And while opinions may shift, the underlying moral principles upon which they are built do not, namely the moral foundations of human rights and human dignity, and respect for the law.
It is difficult to determine the exact causes for difference in the results between your survey and previous ones without knowing the methodological details of your survey. You claim that the differences you found in your results are due to the presentation of additional contextual information. Yet, the survey you are comparing it to, which was presented at a side event on Tuesday by the OpenRoboethics Initative, actually provided more situational and contextual information than your survey, and compared responses to more alternatives than your survey, including remote operated weapons such as drones, and questions of offensive and defensive uses.

Belgium, Germany, and most recently Spain have tried to limit Google’s ability to aggregate news from news media sources in those countries, mainly by requiring Google to pay royalties to the publications that appear on Google News’ feed. Most U.S. news reports on these developments have been fairly basic, setting up a “Europe versus Google” conflict without giving much detail.
To get a better idea of what is going on, I recently communicated with Professor Miquel Peguera, an Internet law expert at the Open University of Catalonia in Barcelona. He writes a blog on ISP Law, co-edits the Journal of Intellectual Property, Information Technology and E-Commerce Law, and has been a visiting scholar at Columbia University. He graciously shared some helpful observations about the new Spanish law.
Mark Sableman: Professor, we’ve all heard that Google actually shut down its Spanish version of Google News because of this law. That sounds pretty drastic. What did the law actually say?
Miquel Peguera: The provision is Art. 32(2) of a major copyright revision law. It's available here (in Spanish). It refers to providers of aggregation services, and it covers only the publishing of non-significant fragments (typically snippets). It does not establish liability, but a levy system. You don't need authorization, but you need to pay a levy, compulsorily handled by a collective society. However, this levy needs further regulatory development.
Sableman: Did the law really target just Google News?
Peguera: Yes, it appears that the main purpose of the law was to make Google News pay for its aggregation of Spanish news sources. Now that Google News has closed down its services, it is possible that this provision will never be enforced, or even deleted from the law. And we’re not sure if the regulations needed to support it will finally be developed.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): From a legal perspective, what does the Second Circuit’s decision mean?
Mayer: There are, broadly speaking, two kinds of arguments about the legality of the particular surveillance program. The first argument is it’s unconstitutional. Usually the constitutional rights advocates refers to the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. Another way of questioning the legality of a surveillance program is saying, “Hey, Congress didn’t say you could do that.” So, setting aside the constitutional issues, Congress just didn’t give the executive the power to conduct that surveillance program. That’s the specific challenge that came up in Second Circuit’s decision. The Court invalidated the NSA’s program on statutory grounds, but didn’t address whether the program is constitutional.
So what prevents the NSA from pointing to another statute, getting another statute, or doing this with something other than phones? The reason why I think the statutory analysis is such a big deal is that surveillance statutes, for the most part, share a lot of language. The law is frustratingly tangled, but there are some points of clarity. One of the points of clarity is this language about relevance. Over and over again in surveillance laws there has to be relevance in an investigation. By holding that relevance doesn’t support a bulk program of this sort, the Second Circuit hasn’t just narrowly ruled on this particular statute or telephones because that same statute applies to all the technologies and that relevance language shows up in all sorts of other statutes.
Let me give you a very concrete example. Until 2013, the Drug Enforcement Administration operated its own bulk telephone metadata surveillance program, and it did that under a different statute, but if that surveillance program were ongoing today, I think the Second Circuit’s reasoning would unambiguously have invalidated that program too.""

YES: If the State Can’t Offer Protection, Firms Need to Act
By Patrick Lin
Companies are suffering major financial losses from cyberattacks, and government seems powerless to do much about it. With no cavalry coming to the rescue, businesses may be morally justified in conducting cybercounterstrikes against their tormentors, even if it is technically illegal.
Here’s why.
Based on an implicit promise to protect its citizens, the state has a duty to take actions against law breakers. If the state can’t fulfill that promise, private actors can be justified in fighting back. In the days of the American frontier, individuals often had to protect themselves. Historically, nations have granted “letters of marque” authorizing citizens to defend themselves against, say, pirates and foreign enemies on the open seas.
Likewise, it may be up to victims of hacking attacks to protect themselves—including taking offensive measures such as “hacking back” when the state can’t prevent or prosecute these crimes.
Does hacking back undermine the rule of law? Arguably, the rule of law no longer exists here. It’s already undermined when malicious attackers have free rein. It’s hard to see how doing nothing helps to solve the problem.

That’s the kind of question Bryant Walker Smith, an assistant professor of law at the University of South Carolina, tries to answer. He’s an expert on the legal implications of self-driving cars. Smith sees a future in which these vehicles all but eliminate crashes, transform liability, and make us look back in horror at the risks we once took on the road.
In his own words:
People ask me, ‘Are you concerned about self-driving cars?’ And I say, ‘Yes, but I’m terrified of today’s cars.’ Thirty thousand people die every year on U.S. roads, and over a million are injured. Ninety-four percent of those crashes are caused by human error.
With self-driving cars, decision-making will no longer exist in real time. It’s going to shift from a driver sitting behind the wheel, reacting impulsively, to teams of designers sitting behind computers, deliberately anticipating situations the vehicle may need to deal with. A lot of the liability will probably transfer to companies--the manufacturers, designers, and suppliers of the various driving systems. They’ll likely be responsible for a greater share of the (hopefully much smaller) pie of total crash costs.""

Recent incidents include ""Maintenance Worker Is Struck And Killed By A Robot""(2013) and ""Robot Crushes And Kills Worker Inside Robot Work Cell"" (2012).

No one is murdering the dream of an open Internet, she said, but it's withering away because no one is prioritizing its protection. On top of that, new Internet users are coming from countries whose citizens aren't protected by a Bill of Rights or a First Amendment.

1584,"August 4, 2015",,,Endgaget,"""The most interesting thing about Black Hat 2015 keynote speaker Jennifer Granick isn't her gender -- though she appears against a backdrop of historically male keynotes. It's that Granick is director of civil liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society. She previously held the same position at the Electronic Frontier Foundation -- and is known for defending some of the more notorious criminal hackers around, including Kevin Poulsen, Aaron Swartz, Jerome Heckenkamp and the hackers in the Diebold Election Systems case. Being the keynote speaker at the Black Hat conference means she's about to go front and center with the very organizations and government entities her clients have hacked. Granick is joining a colorful catalog of former keynoters who tend to represent the interests of the international cybersecurity conference's corporate-enterprise and government attendees.
In 2010, Black Hat had its first female keynote, Jane Holl Lute, who served at the time as the deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Lute's first comment about the nature of cyberspace set the tone for her keynote, which was, in characteristic DHS cybersecurity style, tone-deaf to attendee levels of expertise.
	Lute began, ""How do cyberspace and war zones compare? Wars happen somewhere. They involve somebody. Geography is key. Seizing and holding terrain. Wars happen somewhere, but cyberspace is sort of this space-time thing. Nobody really gets it.""
	Needless to say, the two women couldn't be more different from each other -- and Granick couldn't be more different from Black Hat's typical keynote choices. Curious to see what she had to say about adding her name to Black Hat's storied keynote history, Engadget caught up with Granick for a quick Q&A before she hits the stage.
	In Black Hat's keynote history, you're one of only two women to be an esteemed Black Hat keynote. Does this matter?
	I think it does. I hope I start a flood of future keynotes by any number of the many great women in computer security.
	In a refreshing twist, Cosmopolitan UK upended gender roles for their Avengersinterview with Scarlett Johansson and Mark Ruffalo. Instead of the stereotypical questions Johansson was tired of getting, the magazine instead asked Ruffalo about his skincare routine, his red carpet outfits and whether he slimmed down for the role. How do you anticipate handling questions a male keynote would never get?
	I have an advantage in this community because I'm a lawyer and not a security professional. People don't tend to think they already know everything I have to say. So they tend to take talking to me as an opportunity to ask real questions. I'll try to think of a funny joke, though, just in case someone asks about my beauty regime.

But unlike most 9-year-olds, he didn’t dig around his mother’s closet for a shoebox. Instead, he cannibalized circuit boards, a clock-radio speaker and a remote-controlled tank to build a robotic mailbox that visited his classmates’ desks.
The story is a harbinger of what was to become a defining interest in Asaro’s life: how technology and people interact and influence one another.
Asaro is a philosopher of science, technology and media. He is also a talented practitioner of technology, doing innovative research in the areas of virtual reality, human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, machine learning and robot vision at the National Center for Supercomputer Applications and the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology. For Wolfram Research, he was involved in the design of the natural language interface for Wolfram|Alpha, which is also used by Apple’s Siri and Microsoft’s Bing to answer math queries.
His multiple talents made him a good fit at Illinois Wesleyan, where he double majored in philosophy and computer science.
Asaro traces his interests in those disciplines to a question raised by one of his IWU philosophy professors more than 20 years ago: Can machines think?
“I’ve never really got off that question,” he says. “It started me on this path.”
He again combined computer science and philosophy at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, earning master’s degrees in both before completing his Ph.D. in the history, philosophy and sociology of science.
Asaro is now a visiting fellow at Princeton University’s Center for Information Technology and continues his role as an assistant professor at the New School in New York City, where he served as director of the School of Media Studies’ graduate program.

1600,"August 17, 2015",,,Medium,"Jennifer Stisa Granick’s keynote address is a comprehensive and illuminating account of the past, present, and troubling future of “internet freedom.” It also raises uncomfortable questions for government officials, corporate leaders, and hackers. Let’s look at a few of them, in each category. The overarching concern may be: can we step back from our positions as advocates, and talk openly about what an ideal balance of power and freedom, surveillance and privacy, may look like?
1) Government
JSG observes that security has to be a shared responsibility of government, private firms, and users. But she also notes that each is prone to some overreach. She frankly states, “The U.S. Government talks about security as “cyber”. When I hear “cyber” I hear shorthand for military domination of the Internet.” I agree that US “military domination” of a global network is problematic, as a normative matter. Perhaps thinking about what a sounder military role looked like in the past, largely in “real space,” may help guide us into the future of armed forces on the ‘net.
What does military non-domination look like? We see it in well-ordered states, where the military is always under civilian control. What does “civilian control” of a cybersecurity force look like? Do people outside it get to understand the technical details of its defensive and offensive activities? To what extent do the latter hinge on the former, or vice versa?
I think that independent, third party review of such issues is critical, because otherwise we’ll just end up with ever more intense surveillance of more aspects of our life. John Mueller exposes the grubby commercial spurs leading to overblown security threats. And the ramping up of security capabilities can be self-defeating, particularly if it just provokes military rivals to sink more funds into their own countermeasures. JSG is exactly right to say that the real goal for the US should be “building security for a global network,” not dominating it or monitoring/controlling all of it.

You can see the video here or read a modified version of the speech entitled, ""The End of the Internet Dream.""
It goes through a lot of important history -- some of which is already probably familiar to many of you. But, it's also important to remember how we got to where we are today in order to understand the risks and threats to the future of the internet. The key point that Granick makes is that for too long, we've been prioritizing a less open internet, in favor of a more centralized internet. And that's a real risk:
For better or for worse, we’ve prioritized things like security, online civility, user interface, and intellectual property interests above freedom and openness. The Internet is less open and more centralized. It’s more regulated. And increasingly it’s less global, and more divided. These trends: centralization, regulation, and globalization are accelerating. And they will define the future of our communications network, unless something dramatic changes. 
		Twenty years from now,
You won’t necessarily know anything about the decisions that affect your rights, like whether you get a loan, a job, or if a car runs over you. Things will get decided by data-crunching computer algorithms and no human will really be able to understand why.
The Internet will become a lot more like TV and a lot less like the global conversation we envisioned 20 years ago.
Rather than being overturned, existing power structures will be reinforced and replicated, and this will be particularly true for security.
Internet technology design increasingly facilitates rather than defeats censorship and control.""

He's part of a new community of lawyers working on how to determine who's responsible for accidents involving self-driving vehicles.
""Managing this transition will be very complicated and will, I think, be a source of litigation,"" Smith said.
In a telephone interview with Automotive News correspondent Julie Halpert, he shared his perspective on a few scenarios that could unfold as autonomous vehicles become more mainstream:
Scenario 1: An autonomous car brakes quickly to avoid a collision with a bicyclist. The passenger isn't wearing his seat belt. He's thrown from the seat into the windshield and is injured. He sues the automaker for damages.
There is not a nationwide set of rules for when you can successfully sue someone for an injury they've caused you, and states vary considerably in the rules they apply.
Many states take the position that manufacturers cannot introduce evidence of an injured person's failure to wear their seat belt as a reason for the injuries. Some [automotive] developers are trying to limit liability and also make systems safer by not allowing the car to start if people are not belted. The unbelted user who is thrown from the vehicle will, in most states, need to argue what the manufacturer should have done differently to protect them. And then it is an argument in court over whether that would have been a reasonable design alternative.
The manufacturer could argue that they're interested in protecting user autonomy and that they're under no obligation to impose ignition interlock. They could also argue that there are situations where a user may need to operate a car with the seat belt disengaged.
The plaintiff could also argue that the vehicle should have known that the occupant wasn't belted and therefore should have decelerated more slowly, to mitigate the extent of injury. If the vehicle slowed to avoid the bicyclist, then the driver would be in the difficult position of arguing that the vehicle should have [prioritized] the driver's safety over the vulnerable road user's. The manufacturer could argue that seriously injuring or killing a bicyclist to avoid having the occupant go through the windshield is not an appropriate trade-off.

1619,"August 19, 2015",,,Observer,"""Prof. Frischmann, a member of the faculty at the Cardozo School of Law, wants readers to consider if automating life is making us more robotic. He writes about it in a paper he’s circulating on the Social Science Research Network, “Human-Focused Turing Tests: A Framework for Judging Nudging and Techno-Social Engineering of Human Beings.” He’s revisiting the Turing Test in a new way: not as a way to discern when machines have become like humans, but as a way to discern when humans have become like machines.
“When technology is bad for us immediately, we pick up on the harms immediately, but when it has subtle effects we often don’t stop to assess,” he told the Observer in an interview at his office.
The Turing test was proposed by Alan Turing to determine whether or not machines have begun to demonstrate intelligence. Basically, if a computer can have a text-based chat with a human and convince the human it is not a computer, then the machine is intelligent (in Turing’s framework). In his paper, Prof. Frischmann writes:
The conventional Turing test concerning artificial intelligence focuses on a machine and asks whether the subject is (in)distinguishable from a human being. In a sense, the Turing test establishes an elusive endpoint to which AI experts and others may strive; it is a finish line. But racing to make intelligent machines is only half of the relevant picture. Another race is occurring, but we don’t pay much attention to it, except in science fiction. It occurs on the other side of what I call the Turing line, the human side.

",Can Technology Turn Humans Into Machines?,Robotics
1620,"September 10, 2015",,,Politico Magazine,"This year, the obscure tech-politics debate over whether and how we pay to use the Internet leaped into the mainstream, attracting the voices of Silicon Valley’s top brass, a late-night comedian, millions of disgruntled broadband service consumers and the president. But net neutrality’s big moment was a long time coming, with a varied group of cyber law scholars each making a push for an open Internet.
It was in 2003—pre-Facebook, Twitter and the rest—that Tim Wu first coined the term “net neutrality,” referring to the idea that Internet service providers shouldn’t be able to charge different amounts for different kinds of websites and applications. Seven years later, he, Marvin Ammori and Susan Crawford together wrote an eight-page letter to the Federal Communications Commission arguing for regulations that would prevent Internet service providers from slowing down or blocking some websites’ content while speeding up others’.The rules the FCC eventually imposed, though far from ideal in the eyes of cyber law activists, were struck down in 2014, and the FCC’s new chairman, Tom Wheeler, then proposed yet another set of rules that many saw as worse, essentially allowing for the two-tiered online system that Internet service providers were pining for.
Rallying back after this defeat, Ammori, with help from Stanford law professor Barbara van Schewick, drafted another letter, this time in opposition to Wheeler’s proposal. Ammori circulated the memo throughout Silicon Valley, getting 150 signatures from the likes of Facebook and Google by lobbying big tech CEOs, while van Shewick made monthly trips from Stanford to D.C. to lobby the FCC. Ammori even encouraged David Karp, the CEO of Tumblr, to alert President Obama about the net neutrality problem during a fundraiser in New York. The tipping point was a “Last Week Tonight” segment that Ammori had supplied with facts and data for host John Oliver’s comical talking points. After intense public pressure, Wheeler relented, and is now pressing for stricter net neutrality regulations.

Section 230, he said, still provides important protections that keep the internet the free, open place that it is. “Twisting” laws like stolen property to keep information offline, he said, threatens the internet ecosystem.
“It’s not that there’s no legitimate harm here,” he said. “There certainly is. It’s that it’s a harm we’re still struggling to answer in the law.”

So-called “revenge porn” is being steadily driven off the Internet as platforms like Google and Reddit ban it. Could “revenge data” also be pushed offline? People like Danielle Citron have long called to rethink Section 230, which was authored in the early days of the commercial internet.
Entrepreneurs profiting off of a hack that wreaked havoc on millions of lives were not the people who Section 230 was dreamed up to protect. She said we need more robust protections for stolen data and a provision in the law to easily get it taken down.

How imminent is the threat posed by autonomous lethal robots on the battlefield?
Systems capable of autonomous targeting and firing of weapons are in development, and could be available to militaries in a few years. Of course, you could make crude autonomous weapons today. That is why it is important to move toward a pre-emptive ban now, before states acquire them and refuse to give them up.
Are these so-called ‘killer robots’ distinct from unmanned drones?
Yes. Unmanned drones are controlled by humans remotely, and the humans decide which targets to attack. Autonomous weapons would use sensors and algorithms to select and attack targets on their own. Of course, there are next-generation autonomous combat drones like the X47B and the Taranis that have no remote operators, and could be the first autonomous weapons, depending on how they find targets.
What is the main point of contention being addressed by the Convention?
There is broad agreement among the 120 countries of the CCW that there should always be meaningful human control over the use of weapons. The main point of contention is what exactly that means, and whether a prohibition on autonomous weapons is necessary, or whether we should allow them to be developed under some set of guidelines.

As that ruling recognized, the crux of the matter was dependent on the EU's Data Protection Directive. And that Data Protection Directive is about to be updated. 
	And the end result may be very, very bad for the internet. 
	That's the conclusion of Daphne Keller at Stanford's Center for Internet and Society, who is writing a series of blog posts detailing the problems with the current drafts. At the core of the issue, as Keller notes, the worlds of ""privacy protection"" and ""free speech/intermediary liability protection"" are two separate worlds -- and people on both sides don't seem to realize just how much the two can and do overlap.""

1650,"October 8, 2015",,,Technology Academics Policy,"“The Women Who Won Net Neutrality,” a recent Slate article, recognizes the work of leading women in technology sectors, academia, public interest, and government agencies who worked tirelessly to preserve the free and open Internet. At the top of this list is Stanford’s Professor Barbara van Schewick. Professor van Schewick’s work is cited as having “a bigger impact than entire institutions.”
As the article points out, Professor van Schewick wrote the book on net neutrality.Internet Architecture and Innovation analyzes the architecture of the Internet, how it fosters innovation, and what that suggests for the future. Professor van Schewick shows that the original architecture of the Internet, designed with the intent of allowing sharing between systems, fostered innovation in applications. The pressure to innovate benefited both the development of the Internet and its users. She then argues that structural changes are occurring that are modifying the underlying architecture of the Internet; and stresses that these changes may threaten to remove the innovative nature of the Internet by reducing the amount and quality of application innovation.
Net neutrality is the principle that all Internet traffic should be treated equally to preserve open access to content on the Web. It's a principle that has faced many threats over the years. In 2010, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) attempted to combat these threats with a set of Open Internet rules (classified as an information service under Title I of the Communications Act). But in 2014, after a legal challenge from Verizon, those rules were overturned. The FCC then drafted a new set of rules, this time they were grounded in Title II authority, which classifies the Internet as a public utility. During the comment period, the FCC's server crashed as millions of people weighed in with their support of preserving an open Internet.
On February 26, 2015, the FCC adopted the Open Internet rules; and they went into effect on June 12th.
Throughout all the legal challenges, agency hearings, lobbying, and public comment periods, Professor Barbara van Schewick has been tireless in her efforts to preserve net neutrality because she believes, “it is possible to protect users and innovators while giving network providers the tools they need to manage their networks and allowing the network to evolve.”

When the law faces a new technology, a basic question is who governs it and with what rules? Technological development disrupts regulatory schemes. Take, for example, the challenges the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) now faces with drones. The FAA usually regulates aircraft safety. Drones force the FAA to consider—and in some cases reject as outside the agency’s mandate—issues of privacy, spectrum policy, data security, autonomous decision-making, and more. The pace and complexity of recent technological change has led some to call for the creation of new agencies, including a Federal Robotics Commission. But given the significant hurdles involved in agency creation, it is valuable in the short run to assess what tools we already have.
In Unfair and Deceptive Robots, Woodrow Hartzog takes up the question of who will govern consumer robots. Hartzog proposes that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is best equipped to govern most issues that consumer robots will soon raise. He reasons that the FTC is well prepared both as a matter of subject-matter expertise and as a matter of institutional practice.
This article was a hit at the 2015 We Robot conference. It blends practical guidance, expert knowledge of the FTC, and a range of thoughtful and often amusing examples.

1. PRIORITATE pentru companii care platesc pentru a fi o exceptie. Legea spune ca servicii speciale, precum chirurgia controlata de la distanta, masinile automate sau activitati anti-teroriste pot avea prioritate. Dar specialistii spun ca formularea vaga poate fi exploatata astfel incat si alte companii sa beneficieze de latime de banda mai mare.
2. ZERO-RATING. Conceptul l-ati intalnit cu siguranta, sunt momente in care un furnizor de internet poate sa nu contorizeze traficul de pe un anumit site, lucru esential in contextul dispozitivelor mobile. ""In reteaua X, nu consumi traficul de date cand intri pe Facebook"", de exemplu. Acum, oficialii fiecarei tari trebuie sa decida daca permit sau nu aceasta practica in continuare.
3. CLASE. Furnizorul de internet poate defini clase si sa clasifice astfel cine primeste o banda mai mare sau mai mica. Temerile sunt ca o conexiune peer-to-peer, adica torrentii cei de toate zilele, ar putea fi discriminata si i-ar putea fi alocata o banda cu restrictii.
4. VITEZA MICA in functie de orele de consum ridicat. Reglementarile spun ca traficul poate fi reglat in functie de nivelul de incarcare, dar si atunci cand se prevede o incarcare. Astfel, furnizorul de internet poate justifica o viteza de acces mai mica la internet prin simplul fapt ca ""estimeaza"" o incarcare in perioada imediat urmatoare.""

""The proposal allows ISPs to create fast lanes for companies that pay through the specialized services exception."" This exemption is intended for ""specialized services"" — like medical data, say — but van Schewick argues that the exception is ""too broad,"" and that ""in many cases, it still allows ISPs to offer fast lanes by calling them a specialized service.""The proposal generally allows zero-rating and gives regulators very limited ability to police it, leaving users and companies without protection against all but the most egregious cases.

""The proposal generally allows zero-rating and gives regulators very limited ability to police it, leaving users and companies without protection against all but the most egregious cases."" If a service is zero-rated, it doesn't count towards a users' bandwidth cap or usage costs. This means companies could pay ISPs to be zero-rated — once again creating an unequal internet.

""The proposal allows ISPs to define classes and speed up or slow down traffic in those classes, even if there is no congestion."" ISPs could still choose to discriminate against certain kinds of data (like peer-to-peer torrenting, for example). Van Schewick worries that because ISPs will not be able to identify what ""class"" encrypted data fits in, they will simply put them in the slowest lane — as has happened before. This will discourage the use of encryption, and make the internet less secure.


""The proposal allows ISPs to start managing congestion in the case of impending congestion. That means that they can slow down traffic anytime, not just during times of actual congestion."" Van Schewick thinks this will be used as an excuse for discriminatory traffic management, ""using the justification that congestion was just about to materialise.""""

This has been something American consumers have had a hard time understanding, since such systems are usually framed as ""1-800 numbers for data"" or the data equivalent of free shipping. But van Schewick does a good job explaining the bad precedent set:
""Research shows that zero-rated applications are far more attractive to users than those that are not. In a study commissioned by the CTIA, 74% of users said that they would be more likely to watch videos offered by a new provider if the content did not count against their monthly bandwidth caps. When the online magazine Slate experimented with zero-rating, it told some users that the podcast did not count against their cap. People who were offered the zero-rated podcast were 61% more likely to click on the link.

Vier bezwaren
Ook de Duitse investeerder Ciaran O'Leary heeft een campagne opgezet, waarbij hij zich vooral richt op de komende ongelijkheid tussen rijke dienstenaanbieders en startups. Dit zijn zijn vier bezwaren:
Bezwaar 1: De voorstellen bieden de ISP's de kans om snelwegen te maken voor rijkere bedrijven die gebruik willen maken van de wettelijke mogelijkheid om ""speciale diensten"" aan te bieden. Dat zal vooral innovatieve startups hinderen in een concurrerend speelveld.
Bezwaar 2: De mogelijkheid van ""zero rating"". Dat houdt in dat ISP's sommige diensten niet hoeven mee te tellen in het gebruik van de databundel. Dat maakt dat de consument zacht gedwongen wordt minder andere content te gebruiken die wel telt voor de databundel.
Bezwaar 3: ISP's mogen diensten classificeren naar urgentie, populariteit en de belasting van het plaatselijke net. Die klassen mogen van elkaar verschillen in snelheid als de plaatselijke congestie op het net daarom vraagt. Volgens de Duitse investeerder zou al het versleutelde verkeer in de langzaamste klasse vallen. Net als bij bezwaar 2 is dat nauwelijks te controleren door toezichthouders.
Bezwaar 4: ISP's mogen bij een dreigende congestie het verkeer vertragen. Dat is nauwelijks te controleren en geeft de providers opnieuw een carte blanche.""

Der Entwurf der Verordnung erlaubt Internetprovidern die Einrichtung von ""Überholspuren"" im Netz, für sogenannte Spezialdienste. In der deutschen Fassung des Entwurfs heißen sie ""andere Dienste, die keine Internetzugangsdienste sind"" und ""die für bestimmte Inhalte, Anwendungen oder Dienste (...) optimiert sind (...)"". Die EU-Kommission hatte als Beispiele immer wieder Internetdienste für selbstfahrende Autos oder die Telemedizin genannt – Autohersteller und Krankenhäuser haben jedoch kein Interesse, für eine Überholspur im Netz zu bezahlen. Manche Internetprovider würden hingegen gerne hochauflösende Videos oder Onlinespiele zu Spezialdiensten deklarieren, für deren Bereitstellung die Endkunden extra zahlen müssten.
Der Entwurf verbietet das sogenannte Zero-Rating nicht ausdrücklich. Anbieter von Internetinhalten, etwa von Streamingdiensten, können dabei mit Providern aushandeln, dass ihre Inhalte nicht auf das monatliche Datenvolumen der Kunden angerechnet werden. Dadurch werden Inhalte, die sich dieses Privileg erkaufen können, attraktiver als solche, die sich das nicht leisten können.
Der Entwurf erlaubt es Providern, sogenannte Datenverkehrskategorien einzuführen und unter bestimmten Voraussetzungen unterschiedlich zu behandeln. Filesharing zum Beispiel könnte in eine andere Kategorie eingeordnet werden als Videos oder E-Mails. Auch verschlüsselte Daten könnten eine eigene Kategorie bilden, weil man aus ihnen nicht ohne Weiteres ablesen kann, welche Inhalte sie transportieren. Kritiker wie van Schewick befürchten, Provider könnten – absichtlich oder nicht – bestimmte Kategorien diskriminieren.
Um ""eine drohende Netzüberlastung"" zu verhindern, dürfen die Provider einzelne Kategorien ausdrücklich blockieren, verlangsamen oder verändern. Eine wichtige Einschränkung immerhin gibt es: Sie dürfen das nicht ""auf der Grundlage kommerzieller Erwägungen"" tun. ""

As Ars reported earlier this year, by allowing ""specialised services"" on the Internet, the EU's net neutrality proposals would create a two-tier system with fast and slow lanes. Van Schewick explains that this would be a disaster for innovation in the EU: ""If established companies can pay so that their content loads faster or does not count against users’ monthly bandwidth caps, then those who can’t pay don’t have a chance to compete.""

>""The proposal allows ISPs to create fast lanes for companies that pay through the specialized services exception."" This exemption is intended for ""specialized services"" — like medical data, say — but van Schewick argues that the exception is ""too broad,"" and that ""in many cases, it still allows ISPs to offer fast lanes by calling them a specialized service.
""The proposal generally allows zero-rating and gives regulators very limited ability to police it, leaving users and companies without protection against all but the most egregious cases."" If a service is zero-rated, it doesn't count towards a users' bandwidth cap or usage costs. This means companies could pay ISPs to be zero-rated — once again creating an unequal internet.
""The proposal allows ISPs to define classes and speed up or slow down traffic in those classes, even if there is no congestion."" ISPs could still choose to discriminate against certain kinds of data (like peer-to-peer torrenting, for example). Van Schewick worries that because ISPs will not be able to identify what ""class"" encrypted data fits in, they will simply put them in the slowest lane — as has happened before. This will discourage the use of encryption, and make the internet less secure.
""The proposal allows ISPs to start managing congestion in the case of impending congestion.

“For both of those departments, their policies were extremely brief and probably the least thought out of all the policies we’ve reviewed,” said Harlan Yu, a principal at Upturn.
“By allowing pre-report viewing, statements from officers will always appear more accurate and more credible than other witnesses statements, which would unnecessarily tilt the justice system even further against criminal defendants,” Yu said. “It’s unlikely that any prosecutor or investigator would ever afford other witnesses the ability to watch footage of an incident before giving an untainted statement. It should be no different for officers.”
Yu added that many departments scored poorly when it came to how they let the public access the footage. In all, the group found that only Washington, D.C., and Parker have policies that let people who want to file a complaint about officer misconduct to view any relevant footage.
“Nearly all the other departments rely simply on their state and public records law, but this may not be enough,” Yu said. “In California, for example, all footage is considered public records, but California’s public records act provides a broad investigatory exemption, which effectively means that no California body camera footage is ever required to be made available to anyone outside the department.”""

In his recently published Intellectual Privacy: Rethinking Civil Liberties in the Digital Age (Oxford Univ.

Current technology, he noted, is engineered to create records and preserve drafts. But part of the way we make sense of the world is by thinking, reading, and speaking about issues; protecting the privacy of that process is an important part of free speech. “This zone of intellectual privacy…is essential if we’re to generate new and interesting and possibly destabilizing ideas,” Richards said. “Remember, most of the ideas that we’ve come to cherish the most in our society were once heretical, deviant, destabilizing”—the notions that all people are equal, that they should be able to explore their religious beliefs, that people should be in charge of the government rather than vice versa.""

In the current Age of Big Data, companies are constantly striving to figure out how to better use data at their disposal. And it seems that the only thing better than big data is more data. However, the data used is often personal in nature and thus linked to specific individuals and their personal details, traits, or preferences. In such cases, sharing and use of the data conflict with privacy laws and interests. A popular remedy applied to sidestep privacy-based concerns is to render the data no longer “private” by anonymizing it. Anonymization is achieved through a variety of statistical measures. Anonymized data, so it seems, can be sold, shared with researchers, or even possibly released to the general public.
Yet, the Age of Big Data has turned anonymization into a difficult task, as the risk of re-identification seems to be constantly looming. Re-identification is achieved by “attacking” the anonymous dataset, aided by the existence of vast datasets (or “auxiliary information”) from various other sources available to the potential attacker. It is, therefore, difficult to establish whether anonymization was achieved, whether privacy laws pertain to the dataset at hand, and if so, how. In a recent paper, Ira Rubinstein and Woodrow Hartzog examine this issue’s pressing policy and legal aspects. The paper does an excellent job in summarizing the way that the current academic debate in this field is unfolding. It describes recent failed and successful re-identification attempts and provides the reader with a crash course on the complicated statistical methods of de-identification and re-identification. Beyond that, it provides both theoretical insights and a clear roadmap for confronting challenges to properly releasing data.

Vagle spoke about the USA Freedom Act, encryption backdoors, and how we should be discussing the balance between security and civil liberties. 
Penn Law: What is your reaction to CIA Director Brennan’s most recent comments about the intelligence community having more leeway to do what they need to do?
Jeffrey Vagle: First off, many of us in the cybersecurity community felt that Brennan’s statement was fairly crass, and in bad taste — irrespective of any legal or technical merit it might have. Given the timing, Brennan’s statement appeared more opportunistic and exploitative than anything else.
That said, he made mention of the fact that essentially the intelligence service’s hands are tied because of what he called “hand-wringing” on the part of U.S. politicians and the public — post-[Edward] Snowden revelations. What he fails to recognize, however, is that what he is referring to as “hand-wringing” was actually a popular reaction to the revelations of illegal spying on the part of intelligence agencies. To discover something as illegal and engage in reforms, as modest as they were, probably would not be characterized by most people as “hand-wringing.”
This past summer, the USA Freedom Act was passed, which was in many ways a direct reaction to the Snowden revelations. The USA Freedom Act was meant to reform some of the overreaching aspects of the Patriot Act. For example, it eliminated the bulk metadata phone collection. But it did not eliminate email collection and a few other things. It did require that the FISA Court — which is a secret court — publicize the most important decisions that it makes.
But the USA Freedom Act was viewed, by most, as a very modest reform of the Patriot Act. If Director Brennan is saying that’s “hand-wringing,” it’s really not clear what else he is asking for. If he’s implying that he would like to go back to some of the programs like Section 215 — those have been ruled by many courts, and now by law, as illegal programs.""

Levine is one of four writers of a 23-page letter to leaders of the House Judiciary Committee opposing the Defense of Trade Secrets Act.
The act would allow federal civil suits for misappropriation of trade secrets. State laws currently protect those secrets. It also would allow plaintiffs to have the court seize trade secrets from defendants before even telling them they are being sued.
The Act is supposed to protect the trade secrets of American business, but Levine and his coauthors wrote it would hurt small business and that a federal law is unnecessary since there are already strong state laws.
“While we agree that effective legal protection for U.S. businesses’ legitimate trade secrets is important to American innovation, we believe that the DTSA — which would represent the most significant expansion of federal law in intellectual property since the Lanham Act in 1946 — will not solve the problems identified by its sponsors. Instead of addressing cyber-espionage head ‐ on, passage of the DTSA is likely to create new problems that could adversely impact domestic innovation, increase the duration and cost of trade secret litigation, and ultimately negatively affect economic growth,” the letter reads.""

Debate was raging over the practice of “jailbreaking,” which enabled iPhone users to circumvent locks Apple put on its devices so they could switch carriers or install apps not sold by Apple. The company claimed the practice led to copyright infringement. Then, Granick was civil liberties director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an advocacy group focused on protecting individuals’ rights in the digital world. Her group successfully persuaded the U.S. Librarian of Congress to adopt a rule clarifying that jailbreaking doesn’t violate federal law.
	But last fall, their interests aligned. Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn wanted Apple to disable the encryption on a mobile device whose owner was under investigation. Granick signed on to an amicus brief that defended Apple’s interest in building robust privacy and security features into its products. The brief also argued that Congress specifically chose not to require certain technology companies to create “backdoors” into their encryption features to enable access for law enforcement purposes.

A new report from Barbara van Schewick claims that Binge On violates net neutrality. The report, which was also submitted to the FCC, makes several arguments as to why Binge On goes against net neutrality principles. van Schewick says that despite T-Mobile’s claim that anyone can join Binge On after performing a “minor amount of technical work,” the requirements to joining Binge On are actually “substantial.” She says that those requirements exclude services that use the User Datagram Protocol, “making it impossible for innovative providers such as YouTube to join.” The report also says that Binge On’s requirements discriminate against providers that use encryption.
van Schewick goes on to say that Binge On “distorts competition.” The report points to studies that show that customers prefer zero-rated content that won’t use up their data, which makes free streaming Binge On services more attractive than those that do use data. That also means that those free streaming services are more attractive to video creators.
Another issue that van Schewick has with Binge On’s partners is that the content that they offer is largely commercial. “Binge On stifles free expression,” the report says, because there’s little user-generated or educational content on the service.""

As we've been highlighting, Binge On has numerous problems when it comes to net neutrality, and appears to clearly violate some of the FCC's rules. There's also the fact that T-Mobile flat out liedabout it and claimed that it was ""optimization"" when it's really throttling. 
	The 51-page report by van Schewick details the problems with Binge On in great detail, noting that it falls afoul of the FCC's transparency rules, that it unfairly picks winners and losers and that it harms competition. The core argument:
Binge On undermines the core vision of net neutrality: Internet service providers (ISPs) that connect us to the Internet should not act as gatekeepers that pick winners and losers online by favoring some applications over others. By exempting Binge On video from using customers’ data plans, T-Mobile is favoring video from the providers it adds to Binge On over other video. 
	T-Mobile says that it does not intend to become a gatekeeper on the Internet: It says Binge On is open to all legal video streaming providers at no cost, as long as they can meet some “simple technical requirements.” The idea is that any discriminatory effects of Binge On disappear as more providers join the program. However, the technical requirements published on T-Mobile’s website are substantial. They categorically exclude providers that use the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), making it impossible for innovative providers such as YouTube to join. They discriminate against providers that use encryption, a practice that is becoming the industry standard. While some providers can join easily, a significant number will need to work with T-Mobile to determine whether their service can be part of Binge On. Many will have to invest time and resources to adapt their service to T-Mobile’s systems. The smaller the provider, the longer it will likely take for T-Mobile to get to it.

T-Mobile, one of the country’s largest providers of mobile internet access, launched Binge On in November. The service features video from Netflix, Amazon, HBO and others. Binge On customers can watch this content without it counting against their data allotments.
But on Friday, Barbara van Schewick, a professor at Stanford Law School and director of the university’s Center for Internet and Society, joined YouTube and the Electronic Frontier Foundation in accusing T-Mobile of violating Net Neutrality principles. In her report, van Schewick outlined how Binge On was helping T-Mobile set itself up as an Internet “gatekeeper,” one that would determine “winners and losers online,” and distort competition.
According to van Schewick, by exempting Binge On’s video from customers’ data plans, T-Mobile is providing preferential treatment to Binge On’s partners. The professor also found that while T-Mobile says any video provider can join Binge On, the reality is that T-Mobile requires partners to adhere to a specific technical criteria, which does not accept encryption. The report from Stanford alleges that Binge On is quicker to accept larger services into the program and this effectively discriminates against smaller players who must wait. This also forces video providers to shape their services to T-Mobile’s technical demands. She warned this will mean the end of the “innovation without permission” era.
In addition, van Schewick says Binge On’s partners are all commercial video providers, and notes the lack of non-profit, user-generated and educational offerings.
“As long as Binge On gives special treatment to video as a class,” she wrote, “it undermines the vision of an open Internet where all applications have an equal chance of reaching audiences, and people, not ISPs, choose how to use the bandwidth available to them.”

Binge On lets T-Mobile subscribers watch videos from streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu without eating into their data plan. It's proved popular with users, with T-Mobile claiming video views on its network have ""more than doubled"" since the deal was introduced, but critics say it's creating a tiered internet service, with the Uncarrier given the unfair advantage of deciding who wins and who loses.
""T-Mobile’s Binge On is aptly named — it feels good in the short-term but harms consumers in the long run,"" says Barbara van Schewick, the net neutrality expert and law professor who authored the Stanford study. ""The program limits user choice, distorts competition, stifles innovation, and harms free speech on the Internet. If more ISPs offer similar programs, these harms will only grow worse.""
Schewick's paper collects together many of the primary arguments against Binge On, including the allegation that it constrains consumer choice, penalizing customers who want to use unsupported rival services. For example, Binge On supports Vevo TV for watching music videos, but doesn't make YouTube or Vimeo available; it supports Ustream for live-streaming video, but not Meerkat or Periscope. The study also suggests that technical requirements to sign up to Binge On are more complicated than T-Mobile claims, and that the carrier is tilting the playing field to the advantage of larger firms.
""Binge On allows some providers to join easily and creates lasting barriers for others, especially small players, non-commercial providers, and start-ups,"" writes Schewick.

The FCC’s 2015 Open Internet Order includes the so-called net neutrality guidelines, which prohibit broadband providers (wireline and wireless) from either throttling or prioritizing data based on its source or the type of content.

“By exempting Binge On video from using customers’ data plans, T-Mobile is favoring video from the providers it adds to Binge On over other video,” writes van Schewick.
T-Mobile has maintained that Binge On does not violate the neutrality rules because participating providers do not pay to be part of the program. But because Binge On does have the ability to downgrade video streams, participating services must work with T-Mobile to meet certain technical requirements.
But this requirement, contends van Schewick, is significant enough to be discriminatory.

Barbara van Schewick is a professor of law and Helen L. Crocker Faculty Scholar, as well as serving as director of Stanford Law School’s Center for Internet and Society. Here’s a link to the complete paper.
Binge On is what’s called a zero-rating service. T-Mobile US subscribers can use the service to stream low-resolution video from select streaming platforms like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon.com, HBO and others.
“The program is likely to violate the [Federal Communications Commission’s] general conduct rule,” van Schewick wrote. “Binge On undermines the core vision of net neutrality: Internet service providers that connect us to the Internet should not act as gatekeepers that pick winners and losers online by favoring some applications over others. By exempting Binge On video from using customers’ data plans, T-Mobile is favoring video from the providers it adds to Binge On over other video.”

",Researcher: T-Mobile Binge On likely violates net neutrality,Architecture and Public Policy
1837,"February 1, 2016",,,Advanced Television,"""Barbara van Schewick, Professor of Law and Helen L. Crocker Faculty Scholar at Stanford Law School, Director of Stanford Law School’s Center for Internet and Society, has suggested that US telco T-Mobile’s Binge On service introduced in November 2015 that offers ‘unlimited’ video streaming from selected providers violates key net neutrality principles as currently offered and harms user choice, innovation, competition, and free speech online.
In a detailed paper – T-Mobile’s Binge On Violates Key Net Neutrality Principles – van Schewick, suggests that Binge On undermines the core vision of net neutrality: Internet service providers (ISPs) that connect us to the Internet should not act as gatekeepers that pick winners and losers online by favouring some applications over others. She says that by exempting Binge On video from using customers’ data plans, T-Mobile is favouring video from the providers it adds to Binge On over other video.
She notes that T-Mobile claims that it does not intend to become a gatekeeper on the Internet: It says Binge On is open to all legal video streaming providers at no cost, as long as they can meet some “simple technical requirements”, but van Schewick suggests the requirements published on T-Mobile’s website are substantial.
“They categorically exclude providers that use the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), making it impossible for innovative providers such as YouTube to join. They discriminate against providers that use encryption, a practice that is becoming the industry standard. While some providers can join easily; a significant number will need to work with T-Mobile to determine whether their service can be part of Binge On. Many will have to invest time and resources to adapt their service to T-Mobile’s systems. The smaller the provider, the longer it will likely take for T-Mobile to get to it,” she suggests.
“The result: Binge On allows some providers to join easily and creates lasting barriers for others, especially small players, non-commercial providers, and start-ups. As such, the programme harms competition, user choice, free expression, and innovation,” she concludes.""

John Legere has maintained and defended Binge On saying that it does not violate net neutrality because T-Mobile gives the customer the choice to turn Binge On on or off. The paper also claims that T-Mobile is likely violating the FCC’s general conduct rule.

1843,"January 31, 2016",,,Tech Times,"""A Stanford University law professor has argued that T-Mobile's Binge On service, which allows users to stream content from a list of approved providers without eating into their monthly data allocation, is illegal. The professor argues that the system set up by T-Mobile favors some content providers over others, violating rules of fair competition.
Professor Barbara van Schewick, a net neutrality expert, has filed a 51-page document with the FCC outlining various arguments as to why Binge On is in violation of the FCC's Open Internet Order of 2015.
The first argument claims that the system distorts competition. Schewick explains that providers selected to participate in the Binge On program have a competitive advantage because consumers are more likely to choose content from those providers as opposed to others that will cause to have their data subtracted from the total amount allocated to their plan.
In addition, video creators are more apt to use the Binge On approved platforms for their content because they realize consumers are more likely to use those platforms, creating additional competition distortion.
Schewick goes on to argue that user choice is limited by Binge On and that T-Mobile users on the carrier's lowest qualifying plan can watch unlimited amounts of video from approved platforms but only an average of nine minutes of video per day from non-participating platforms.
She also claims that free expression is stifled as a result of the Binge On plan. Because the 42 currently approved providers are almost all offering commercial entertainment and ""not user generated, educational or nonprofit video.""
""It turns the mobile Internet offered by T-Mobile into an optimal platform for commercial entertainment at the expense of all other speakers. This undermines the potential of the Internet as a democratic space for free expression,"" she says.""

		Net neutrality’s core tenet is that service providers shouldn’t be allowed to discriminate between different types of traffic they’re asked to carry. By offering some video services – including Netflix, Hulu and HBO – and not others as “free” streaming options, and not counting mobile data consumed from those services toward a user’s monthly cap, T-Mobile is essentially favoring some kinds of video content over others, van Schewick wrote.

“Binge On allows some providers to join easily and creates lasting barriers for others, especially small players, non-commercial providers, and start-ups,” according to van Schewick. “As such, the program harms competition, user choice, free expression, and innovation.”
Stiff Net neutrality regulations on ISPs were upheld last year by the FCC, but carriers have vowed to challenge their validity in court.
The report from van Schewick, which can be read in full here, cites numerous problems with Binge On. The program excludes services that use the user datagram protocol (UDP), which includes YouTube.

And it all comes down to Net Neutrality – as well as how the carrier is “optimizing” video streams. Seeing as video data is being handled differently from other data being used on T-Mobile’s network, many have said that it violates Net Neutrality, although the FCC did come out shortly after Binge On launched and stated that it in fact does not violate Net Neutrality. Now a new study coming out of Stanford believes that Binge On might be illegal.
The study coming out of Stanford suggests that the service can kill the competition. A few examples that were cited were the fact that Vevo is supported in Binge On, but not YouTube or Vimeo. Another was the fact that Ustream is supported, but not Periscope or Meerkat (and as much as T-Mobile’s CEO loves Periscope, you’d think it would be added). There are many other examples listed in the study, and the fact that if other ISP’s and wireless carriers start to do something similar to Binge On, it could help some video streaming services get more customers and stream more than their competitors. Which still affects Net Neutrality in a way.
While the FCC has come out and stated that Binge On does not violate Net Neutrality, they might come back around and revisit Binge On and change their minds. Binge On is a great service – although it’s had a pretty rocky start – many are still not too happy about it optimizing all video streamed on T-Mobile’s network. For example, YouTube is downgraded to 480p or DVD quality, while it’s not part of Binge On. And thus making the experience for many users, not that great.

The study is the latest in a string of bad PR T-Mobile has braved since launching the program three months ago.

For instance, the European Court of Justice in October 2015 struck down the European Commission's Safe Harbour Decision that had declared the data exchange framework established between the U.S. and Europe as secure. Albert Gidari, Director of Privacy at Stanford University Law School's Center for Internet and Society, called the decision a “watershed moment” because it “largely invalidated Safe Harbor data transfers to the U.S. and called into question all other bases for data transfer to the U.S. as well.”
The European Union also reached agreement on its landmark General Data Protection Regulation, which gives citizens increased control over their personal data and sets continent-wide standards for the export of personal data outside of Europe. Omer Tene, Vice President of Research and Education at the International Association of Privacy Professionals, called the regulation a “once-in-a-generation legal reform which will shape the web's next decade.
 
“The Paris nightclub massacre unleashed a wave of security measures that, as we know in the U.S. post-9/11, will take a long time to roll back,” said Gidari.
 
Data breach fears also grew, added Tene, due to the “increased rollout of the Internet of Things (IoT), with smart cities, smart cars, smart toys and a whole variety of devices talking to each other and silently documenting our digital trail.”
 
Gidari seemed to agree, adding, “The privacy impacts of new technology have been experienced by each and every generation. The telephone, camera and hearing aids all raised red privacy flags in their time. But as technology gets adopted, laws catch up to address perceived privacy inadequacies, usually just in time to meet the next innovation.”""

But Woodrow Hartzog, a law professor at Samford University and the owner of a Roomba nicknamed Rocko, argued that there’s nothing wrong with developing an emotional attachment to a robot. Still, issues do arise, he said, when we trick ourselves into believing that those nonhuman entities can reciprocate our affection. In other words, we should worry less about killer robots than deceptive ones, whether their deceptions arise by accident or design.

This concern came up in a different way when Newman asked the panelists whether robots should be allowed to lie to their human owners. Hartzog insisted that such questions force us to remember that robots are essentially tools. As such, whether a robot should lie depends on its basic purpose. Patric Verrone, writer and producer of Futurama, noted that it’s sometimes frustrating when a spell checker repeatedly informs us of our errors, but at core that’s a spell checker’s job—we wouldn’t want it to deceive us, even if it could make us happier by doing so.

""They discriminate against providers that use encryption, a practice that is becoming the industry standard. While some providers can join easily, a significant number will need to work with T-Mobile to determine whether their service can be part of Binge On. Many will have to invest time and resources to adapt their service to T-Mobile’s systems. The smaller the provider, the longer it will likely take for T-Mobile to get to it.""
YouTube developed a protocol called QUIC that relies on UDP and improves online video performance, van Schewick noted. But this disqualifies YouTube from Binge On.

Daniel is a staff attorney at EFF, where he occupies the Mark Cuban Chair to Eliminate Stupid Patents and focuses on patent reform.
Daniel will be speaking at SCaLE 14x about the patent system and open source licensing. Find out more in this interview.

Why are there so many software patents?
It is far too easy to get software-related patents that have broad and vague claims. This rewards people who game the patent system and hurts people who actually develop software. The current system also encourages companies to stockpile patents for defensive purposes. As long as the patent office keeps issuing software patents, many companies will feel they have little choice but to keep applying for them.
Is there a practical way for a developer to be sure they're not infringing on a software patent?
No.
There are approximately 400,000 software patents currently in force and about 50,000 new software patents every year. And each of these patents has multiple claims. One paper estimated that if all software firms conducted thorough patent clearance, the annual cost of that process would be greater than the market capitalization of the entire industry.
Firms can do targeted searches to try and minimize risk (looking at the patent portfolio of direct competitors, for example), but they will always be at risk of surprise patent attacks.
Are open source developers more or less vulnerable than proprietary developers to patent attacks?
This is an interesting question. In theory, open source development should be more vulnerable because the code is available for inspection and thus available for patent infringement analysis. In practice, I don't think it makes much difference. This is because software patents tend to be very vague and are claimed at quite high levels of abstraction. Patent trolls can just analyze the user interface and general functionality of software. For example, you don't need to see the actual code to figure out if someone is infringing a patent that claims online shopping carts. So all developers are vulnerable to patent attacks.
Do we need fundamental reform of the patent system with regard to software patents?
Yes. I don't think software patents promote innovation. I think they primarily serve to entrench incumbents with huge patent portfolios and to reward opportunistic patent trolls. Ultimately we should rethink whether software patents should be allowed at all.""

1896,"February 12, 2016",,,The State,"""Bryant Walker Smith is an assistant professor of law at the University of South Carolina. The university’s website says he is an internationally recognized expert on the law of self-driving vehicles. He previously led the legal aspects of automated driving program at Stanford University, according to USC.
Smith answered questions from The State about the development of driverless vehicles.
Q. Why is the world exploring and developing automated, or driver-less cars?
A. The potential benefits – while by no means inevitable – are tremendous. Safety: Driving is a leading cause of death in this country, in fact ‘the’ leading cause for young people into their 20s. Mobility: Today’s transportation system is woefully inadequate for people who can’t drive because of age, disability, or income. Efficiency: Today's transportation system also wastes time, space, money, energy, and the environment. Automated driving could help address these problems. And, like past innovations from motor vehicles to the internet, it will create opportunities – and, yes, challenges – that are unimaginable today.
Q. How close are we today to deploying driverless cars on American roadways? How does that compare with other developed nations?
A. That depends on what counts as driverless. A so-called “level 5” car that can drive itself anywhere, anytime is still a long way away. But you can buy a car today that will do a lot of the braking, steering, and accelerating for you — as long as you're ready to step back in when it can't. Meanwhile, truly driverless shuttles carrying passengers at low speeds are going to start appearing in more cities here and abroad. Automated driving involves big multinational companies and small startups as well as developed and developing countries.
Q. How could computers possibly anticipate road situations a driver may have to deal with better than the human that actually encounters any given situation on the road in real time?
A. That's a critical challenge. We become better drivers by practicing, by learning what to expect and how to deal with it. The designers of self-driving vehicles are also learning every day. And – this is the amazing part – the vehicles themselves are learning and, crucially, sharing what they’ve learned. The fact that you drive a lot doesn’t mean that I become a better driver. But one self-driving car can learn from another. That's actually happening. Now, these vehicles will not be perfect. But neither are humans – more than 90 percent of crashes are caused at least in part by human error, including driving aggressively, carelessly, and drunk. Self-driving cars will not drink or text.
Q. What are the major remaining hurdles that must be overcome before this technology becomes a viable feature of road travel in the U.S.?
A. The relevant technologies still need to reach a demonstrated level of socially acceptable risk. This is a really hard problem with technical, legal, and social dimensions. How safe is safe enough? And how do we know that a self-driving vehicle can actually attain that level of safety? These aren't questions that can be answered all at once for all of the 3 trillion vehicle miles that Americans travel every year. That’s why developers are likely to begin with slow speeds, simple environments and supervised operations. Location matters, and some communities will have advanced systems before others. I'm looking for a developer of an automated driving system to publicly and candidly explain how it defines safety, how it measures that safety, and how it will monitor that safety over the lifetime of its system. When that happens, self-driving cars won't be far behind.""

Her research and papers on network neutrality shaped the US Federal Communications Commission's work and rulings on the issue. In a Skype interview with Kim Arora, she spoke about the latest Trai decision and net neutrality around the world.
	How would you compare the TRAI ruling in India with net neutrality legislations elsewhere in the world?
	Regulators around the world are looking at how to deal with zero-rating right now. Trai is the first regulator to focus exclusively on issues of differential pricing and exempting applications from data caps. As a result, they could come up with a holistic approach to these practices. Part of the reason why we have seen other regulators in the US or the EU adopt case-by-case decisions is that they were thinking of the many aspects of net neutrality at once. They focused on rules for blocking and technical discrimination. When they got to zero-rating, they basically ran out of time and (decided to) deal with it case by case.
	But India would have to look at those other issues later too.
Yes. The net neutrality regime is incomplete if it only addresses economic forms of discrimination like zero rating, or only technical forms of discrimination. The simple insight at the core of net neutrality is that we do not want companies that connect us to the internet to control what happens on the internet. If you only ban one practice and not the others, you haven't really protected the open internet. What's great about the Indian decision is that it provides a full set of rules for different types of zero rating. These give certainty to the market.
Do you think the Trai decision makes a clear enough distinction between differential and discriminatory treatment of data services?

	The Trai decision is more nuanced than that. It bans harmful forms of price differentiation but allows forms that do not create concerns. The practices banned by the regulation are zero rating for a fee. I think that is a right decision because allowing application providers to pay to be zero-rated is to allow them to pay to get a competitive advantage. That will change the internet as we know it. On the internet, low costs have allowed a large number of people to develop new applications and become entrepreneurs. That's the first big practice banned by the rules. The second is any kind of differential pricing or exemption from bandwidth caps based on content or type of content. So that applies to programs where an ISP zerorates a few applications and a class of similar applications. Third category is where an ISP says my zero rating-program is open to all providers in a certain category and there is no fee...""

1911,"February 25, 2016",,,US News,"Q: What does net neutrality mean?
A: Net neutrality is a principle that has allowed the Internet to serve as a platform for free speech, innovation and economic growth. According to that principle, Internet service providers like Verizon or Comcast that connect us to the Internet should not control what happens on the Internet. That means that ISPs should not have the power to block or slow down websites, make some sites more attractive than others, or charge Internet companies fees to reach people faster. 
Q: Why do we need net neutrality rules now? Hasn’t the Internet worked well without net neutrality rules?
A: Net neutrality rules preserve the open Internet as we know it. The principle of net neutrality was initially built into the technical architecture of the Internet. In the mid-1990s, however, technology emerged that allows ISPs to interfere with what happens on their networks. Since then, the Federal Communications Commission, the federal agency in charge of regulating the nation’s communications networks, has acted to protect this principle in various ways, creating a de-facto net neutrality regime in the U.S. As a result, innovation and online speech in the U.S. have continued to thrive with only a few instances of blocking or discrimination. By contrast, in countries where ISPs weren’t prohibited from doing so, ISPs have often used this new technology to block or slow down sites to increase their profits, manage their networks, or shut out unwanted content.
ISPs around the world would also like to use this new technology to charge Internet companies fees to be in the fast lane. These fast lanes would give better service to companies who pay our ISP when their data travels to us over our ISP’s network. This would be a radical departure from how the Internet has operated over the past 30 years.
Traditionally, Internet companies have paid their own ISPs for access to the Internet, but they have not paid additional fees to our ISPs. Our ISPs are already paid by us. This system has kept the costs of online innovation and speech incredibly low. It ensures that everybody, including those without a lot of resources – start-ups, small businesses, nonprofits, artists, activists and educators – has an equal chance of reaching people online. The future of economic growth and democratic discourse in the U.S. and around the world depends on meaningful net neutrality protections.

Mr. Richards is the author of “Intellectual Privacy,” a book that examines the dangers of a society in which technology and law conspire to eliminate the possibility of thinking without fear of surveillance. He argues that intellectual creativity depends on a baseline measure of privacy, and that privacy is being eroded by cameras, microphones and sensors we’re all voluntarily surrounding ourselves with.
“If we care about free expression, we have to care about the ways in which we come up with interesting things to say in the first place,” he said. “And if we are always monitored, always watched, always recorded, we’re going to be much more reluctant to experiment with controversial, eccentric, weird, ‘deviant’ ideas — and most of the ideas that we care about deeply were once highly controversial.”

It's not privacy vs. security at all, but rather who gets to set the rules over how software works in an era where software controls everything.
We live in a software-defined world.

But, software is written by humans. Increasingly, our reality will obey the rules encoded in software, not of Newtonian physics. Software defines what we can do and what can be done to us. It protects our privacy and ensures security, or not. Software design can be liberty-friendly or tyranny-friendly.
This battle is over who gets to control software, and thus the basic rules of the world we live in. Who will write the proverbial laws of physics in the digital world? Is it the FBI and DOJ?

Since so many people -- including the DOJ -- seem to think that Apple can just create this code and then make it disappear, this filing is super useful in debunking that claim. It first notes that the Court did try to put in some ""safeguards"" against abuse of the code, but then explains why those won't help:
These rules are not meaningful barriers to misuse and abuse of the forensic capabilities this Court is ordering Apple to create. First, the Order assumes that Apple will create the Custom Code without any vulnerabilities in its implementation. Vulnerabilities are common in software code, including Apple’s iOS, and despite Apple’s best efforts. The government dismissively downplays the effort required to develop and update the Custom Code, stating that Apple “writes software code as part of its regular business,” including “routinely patch[ing] security or functionality issues” in iOS and “releas[ing] new versions of [iOS] to address issues.” Application at 15. But creating software (especially secure software) is complex, and software development requires rigorous testing.""

“From a policy perspective, this is an obvious violation of net neutrality principles,” van Schewick told Motherboard. “What Comcast is doing is a textbook example of an ISP using its gatekeeper power to pick winners and losers online, and that is one of the core things that the FCC’s open internet rules were designed to prevent.”
Van Schewick says the Stream TV controversy has implications that go beyond zero-rating and net neutrality, and could affect the competitive dynamics of the national video market as a whole.
“The cable TV market is extremely concentrated, which is why the FCC has so much hope that online video will bring greater competition,” said van Schewick. “If they allow cable giants to leverage their market power to stifle online video services, it will have killed their hope of bringing greater competition to the market.”""

Some providers, especially those outside the US, might not even know they need to apply to T-Mobile to be included in Binge On.

This could easily compromise the security of the new unlocking code, as argued by in the amicus brief filed with Judge Pym by Jennifer Granick and Riana Pfefferkorn from Stanford's Center for Internet and Society (also covered previously by Techdirt):
There is also a danger that the Custom Code will be lost or stolen. The more often Apple must use the forensic capability this Court is ordering it to create, the more people have to have access to it. The more people who have access to the Custom Code, the more likely it will leak. The software will be valuable to anyone eager to bypass security measures on one of the most secure smartphones on the market. The incentive to steal the Custom Code is huge. The Custom Code would be invaluable to identity thieves, blackmailers, and those engaged in corporate espionage and intellectual property theft, to name a few. 
Ms. Granick and Ms. Pfefferkorn may not have contemplated demands by defense counsel to examine the software on their own systems and according to their own terms, but their logic applies with equal force to evidentiary challenges to the new code: The risk of the software becoming public increases when it is examined by multiple defense counsel and their experts, on their own systems, with varying levels of technical competency. Fundamentally, then, basic criminal trial processes such as challenges to expert testimony and evidence that results from that testimony based on this new software stand in direct tension with the public interest in the secrecy and security of the source code of the new iPhone unlocking software. ""

Ryan Calo of the University of Washington has recently published Robots in American Law, a legal research paper examining the judicial challenges presented by robots—and raising concerns that judges are not equipped to grapple with these new puzzles.
Calo argues that, unlike the internet of the 1990s, robots have already established a legal case history. The '90s saw courts grappling with legal decisions transformed by the previously-unheard-of capabilities of the internet, such as instantaneous transfer of goods and services across borders. Robots, however, have existed in some form for decades, giving them the opportunity to be involved in court cases long before the current explosion in robotics. In three parts, Calo presents a series of case studies, first discussing “robots as objects of law,” moving on to instances where robots were used as “metaphors or analogies that actually drive the decisions of courts,” and finally hypothesizing how existing case law may impact the development of robotics law.""

Supporters of driverless cars, Smith argues, can bolster their case without passing a law like the ones in California and Nevada explicitly regulating their use. “What I recommend,” he says, “is to start by doing a close, careful legal audit of existing law. Identify all of the potential provisions in the vehicle code and other laws that are relevant to automated vehicles. Then decide if those need to be changed.”""

After Medium's legal team refused to remove the article in question, the Malaysian government forced at least some internet service providers to block the entire Medium network.
""The post stays up,"" wrote Medium's legal team.
But other posts do come down.
It's a ""cat and mouse"" game, says Medium lawyer Alex Feerst - one where the company must keep on top of large amounts of spam and other nefarious posts.
Medium has started to develop machine-learning tools to alleviate some of the workload from a safety team that consists of just five people - two of them part-time.
What a machine can't determine, though, is what constitutes harassment. Here the team walks an almost impossible tightrope, one which Twitter already seems to be falling off as high-profile users flee.
""If someone feels that they have been a victim of something, and wants to come on Medium and expose that story, that has implications for the people that they name,"" explains Sarah Agudo, Medium's head of legal.
""We aren't in a position to be arbiters of what's the truth and what's right or not.""
Feerst says the team discusses at length the implications of maintaining Medium as a ""safe space"" - a consequence of an internet that is changing.
""There was an era when people did the bare minimum and just said 'we're not taking it down, it all stays up'. That era in some ways is over, because doing the bare minimum is less than we're going to do.
""We are going to take things down that are unsafe, that are hate speech, that are harassment. It's not a legal obligation, it's an obligation to the ecosystem of the site.""
But there's one massively important principle, Feerst stresses.
""You shouldn't necessarily be kept safe from other people challenging your ideas.""""

1971,"March 1, 2016",,,Motherboard,"""This case is a curio of weird American history, and it’s a frustrating look at gender roles at the time. But it’s not entirely frivolous to look back at the case now that a Google driverless car has been deemed at fault in a crash. The Frye case was recently resurfaced by Ryan Calo, a law professor at the University of Washington, in his paper Robots in American Law, which argues that judges have had a seriously flawed view of what a “robot” is.
The Frye case is instructive, he says, because judges regularly look at robots as entities that strictly follow orders. Historically, judges have defined robots as something that is programmed and is not capable of making its own decisions. In Frye, that definition was extended to a girl.
“The idea is that a robot is what a person or entity becomes when completely controlled by another. Such a person or entity is not capable of fault or knowledge, leaving the person behind the machine—the programmer—at fault,” Calo wrote. “While a robot, no one sees, hears, or does evil.”
Does that mean that if a driver can take control from an automated system that he or she must in order to not be at fault in the event of a crash? That’s the way courts have leaned before, Calo says, and it’s likely the reason why Google is focusing on making driverless cars without steering wheels altogether.
“As long as a human is in the loop somewhere, does that mean they can bear responsibility?” Calo said. “That came up in a lot of the cases I looked at—if there’s the possibility of a person intervening, they tend to be looked at as the one at fault.”""

But Apple opposed the ruling, objecting to building what it calls a “back­door.”In a mes­sage posted on the company’s web­site, CEO Tim Cook said that while the com­pany believes the FBI’s inten­tions are good, this demand is an “unprece­dented step” that “threatens the secu­rity of our cus­tomers.” The case is raising the stakes in a com­plex and long-​​running standoff between gov­ern­ment and Sil­icon Valley over access to encrypted data—one that involves bal­ancing con­sumers’ dig­ital pri­vacy with the author­i­ties’ ability to inves­ti­gate crime or terrorism.
Andrea Matwyshyn, pro­fessor in the School of Law, studies tech­nology inno­va­tion and its legal impli­ca­tions. We asked her to examine how this case might play out, with a par­tic­ular focus on its poten­tial impact on future fed­eral inves­ti­ga­tions, the average iPhone user’s pri­vacy, and the global market.
In a mes­sage to cus­tomers, Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote that while the gov­ern­ment may argue that using this back­door would be lim­ited to this case, “there is no way to guar­antee such con­trol.” He added that the gov­ern­ment could extend this “breach of pri­vacy” to demand that Apple create sur­veil­lance tech­nology and other soft­ware to access users’ phones without their knowl­edge. Are these fears jus­ti­fied, and if a so-​​called “master key” is cre­ated, how broad could its usage be by the government?
Cer­tainly any case law arising from this ex parte demand by the Depart­ment of Jus­tice would create prece­dent that other courts would regard as instruc­tive for sim­ilar future law enforce­ment demands. It’s fair to worry about a slip­pery slope arising from the out­come of this dis­pute: If pri­vate sector enti­ties become con­scripted as unwilling agents of law enforce­ment and are no longer free to design their own prod­ucts to meet the demands of their cus­tomers, our innovation-​​driven economy will be per­ma­nently damaged.
To date, Con­gress has been unwilling to leg­is­late on the point of requiring tech­nology com­pa­nies to alter their product designs to include law enforce­ment “back­doors,” despite aggres­sive lob­bying efforts from law enforce­ment. This ex parte order against Apple poten­tially rep­re­sents law enforcement’s attempt to cir­cum­vent this con­gres­sional impasse by achieving a func­tion­ally sim­ilar result incre­men­tally through the courts.""

1990,"February 18, 2016",,,Privacy Radio International,"""While most states have passed legislation to prevent cyber harassment, Danielle Citron, a professor of law at the University of Maryland, says the law often breaks down and fails to protect targets of online harassment.
“If you’re going to be convicted of harassment, the state’s got to prove that someone intentionally, repeatedly, [and] persistently targeted the person with speech that we can punish,” says Citron. “Some of the problem when you have a huge collective of people targeting a specific person is that it may be that any given person in the mob may contribute a little to the abuse, but not one person is responsible for persistent, targeted abuse.”
Taken together, a wave of online harassment from many different people can be intimidating and threatening. Yet, it presents a huge barrier for law enforcement looking to bring charges against any one individual.
“The law has great potential here, but as we’ve seen it’s a blunt instrument — sometimes it fails us,” says Citron. “What we saw in Zoe’s case, she gave up because it just became too much for her and her loved ones to bare.”
Citron, author of the book “Hate Crimes in Cyberspace,” says part of the problem lies in education. Many police officers and other law enforcement officials do not know how to investigate cyber harassment, or recognize the scale of the problem. Between 2010 and 2013, for example, about 2.5 million cases of cyberstalking occurred, yet federal prosecutors pursued just 10 cases.
“They need a lot of training to understand the real significance of this kind of behavior and its real world impact,” Citron. “That really presents problems, not only if you have all the evidence and you can trace all of the posts to specific individuals, even if they all are engaging in prescribable conduct like a true threat, it may be that law enforcement feels outgunned.”
In addition to education, Citron says that social attitudes among law enforcement officials is also a problem.
“In my book, I document how law enforcement will tell victims, ‘Eh, turn your computer off,’ [or] ‘Boys will be boys — it’s no big deal,’” she says. “I think we’re making a little bit — I’ll say very modest progress.

Beyond that, Smith said he found pretty much zero unambiguous red flags, prompting him to title his research paper “Automated Vehicles Are Probably Legal in the United States.” And even that New York law, he says, is open to interpretation because it could be argued that, with a self-driving car, no “person” is actually driving it, so therefore there is no conflict.""

2060,"March 23, 2016",,,Metro International,"""At least 34 people are reported dead after a series of blasts at Zaventem International airport and Maelbeek metro station in Brussels on Tuesday.
The attacks come four days after Salah Abdeslam, the main suspect in the jihadist terror attack in Paris on Nov. 13 last year, was arrested in the Molenbeek area of the Belgian capital.
Brian Nussbaum, expert on terrorism and Richard Lachmann, a political sociologist at Rockefeller College in New York, give Metro their opinions on the devastating attacks.
Brian Nussbaum, expert on terrorism at Rockefeller College: “This attack will change the rhetoric around the Syrian refugee issue in Europe.”
Why has Brussels been attacked?
It appears — though it’s important to note that it is still to early for the evidence to corroborate this so far — that it is likely this is the work of an operational cell that had ties to Abdelslam. Given his recent arrest last Friday, attacks that had been in the planning stage may well have been sped up in response to his arrest, and fears that it would hasten the roll-up of the broader cell or certain associates of his. This effect is a common concern among security forces and law enforcement, and one reason they often monitor suspects rather than arresting them immediately.
Why are there no control points at the entrance to the Zaventem international airport?
Extending security and surveillance around sensitive targets is sometimes a good idea, but has real tradeoffs in terms of cost, convenience, and manageability for security staff. Often it merely moves the perimeter outward, broadening the area that needs to be monitored and moving the unprotected gathering spaces away from the critical mass of security staff. Traditional airport security has moved this insecure perimeter into the entryways of today's airports — a part of airports we've seen targeted by attackers from Los Angeles in 2002 and 2013, to Glasgow in 2007, and now Brussels in 2016.
Are the control points a necessity?
Control points may be necessary, though they are typically more valuable for crowd control and traditional public safety than for counter terrorism. That said, in high risk areas or at high risk targets, they can be very valuable. We saw during the Paris attacks that checkpoints at the soccer stadium resulted in less deadly suicide bombings than would have occurred if the attacker had gotten inside.
Should Europe’s migration policy be changed?
I think there is little doubt that this attack will — as Paris did — change the rhetoric around the Syrian refugee issue in Europe. This, despite the fact that while many of the attackers in both cases had been foreign fighters in Syria, they have overwhelmingly been first and second generation European citizens and not part of any migrant flow like what is happening today. However, despite the limited ties between these attackers and such refugee populations, that is not likely to stop those who have strong pre-existing positions against immigration and those who are merely afraid of further terrorist attacks from conflating the two issues. There may well be some risk of increased terrorist mobility from large refugee flows, but that issue seems relatively minor compared to the humanitarian need and importance of the EU and world community helping the people fleeing the barbarity of the Assad regime and ISIS. There are real security concerns, but as everywhere else in public policy those concerns need to be balanced against a host of other issues, costs, values and needs.""

The same should hold true for any other biometric authentication, Gidari said, whether it’s a physical feature like an iris pattern, a unique characteristic like a speech pattern, or a behavioral trait like a typing or clicking pattern. Any action or characteristic that’s programmed to unlock a phone becomes a way of communicating and should be protected, he said.""

2135,"November 6, 2014",,,Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies,"""We are entering the age of robotics. Robots will soon be assisting us in our homes; stacking our warehouses; driving our cars; delivering our Amazon purchases; providing emergency medical care; and generally taking our jobs. There’s lots to ponder as they do so. One obvious question — obvious at least to lawyers — is whether the age of robotics poses any unique challenges to our legal system?
That’s a question Ryan Calo tries to answer in his article “Robotics and the Lessons of Cyberlaw”. He does so by considering the lessons learned from the last major disruptive technology: the internet. When it was originally introduced in the late 80s and early 90s, the ultimate fate of the internet was uncertain (and still is, to an extent). Nevertheless, it clearly created new opportunities and new challenges for the law. Some of those challenges have been dealt with; some have not.
	Robots are distinct from the internet. Although they may be integrated into it — and thus form part of the ever-expanding internet-of-things — they have a number of unique technological properties. Still, Calo thinks there is something to be learned from the internet era. Over the next couple of posts, I want to see what he has to say.
	I start today by looking at his take on the distinctive properties of robots vis-a-vis the distinctive properties of the internet. This takes the form of a compare-and-contrast exercise. I start by considering Calo’s take on the three key features of the internet, and the challenges and opportunities created by those three features. I then follow-up by looking at his take on the three key features of robotics, and the challenges and opportunities they pose. I won’t offer much in the way of evaluation and criticism, except to say that I think there is much to mull over in what Calo has to say. Anyone with an interest in the social implications of robotics should be interested in this.""

For example, in most T-bone wrecks today, the blame goes to the driver who ignored the traffic signal. If the innocent victim’s vehicle is automated, however, its driver might come after the manufacturer for not having foreseen and avoided the accident. The uncertainty comes in predicting how judges and juries will rule in such cases, as well as in trickier cases where the car must choose between targets. (Hit the nun or the 5-year-old?)

2150,"November 20, 2014",,,The Fiscal Times,"""Ryan Calo, who teaches law at the University of Washington, worries about a lack of government resources. “There isn’t enough technical expertise in government,” he says. Calo notes that when a crisis arose in 2009 regarding sudden acceleration in Toyota automobiles, some suggested the problem might lie in vehicle software. But the Department of Transportation did not have the expertise to research it. “So they went and asked NASA to take a break from keeping the space station running and driving robots on Mars to look at this Toyota,” marvels Calo. (NASA’s report found no software glitch.) Calo now argues for the creation of a new federal agency—”a repository of expertise, which like NASA has a whole bunch of computer scientists, whose job is to advise other agencies and congress.” A similar agency called the Office of Technology Assessment advised congress after 1972, but was abolished by Republicans in 1995.
Calo studies the legal and ethical implications of robotics, and finds numerous reasons to worry about the U.S. response to them. “This disconnect between knowledge and policy will be harmful,” he warns. He notes that Nevada, influenced hastily by Google, passed a law to accommodate self-driving cars in 2011. But the law was written to cover fully autonomous vehicles like Google is developing, not the proliferating partially autonomous ones sold by Audi and others. It had to be repealed and rewritten. The Food and Drug Administration approved the use of robotic surgery techniques, but then safety concerns emerged. “The FDA may have moved too quickly on approving robotic surgery,” says Calo, “whereas I and others believe the Federal Aviation Administration is holding up drones unnecessarily.”""

2202,"July 1, 2016",,,National Science Foundation,"""New technology often raises new ethical questions -- and those questions only multiply as technology advances.
Up until now, technology has largely remained dependent on action by a user, often in a particular setting. But in the age of co-robots, devices are breaking free of that model, interacting with people other than their users, and with other pieces of technology. They're also beginning to act in ways beyond what their users -- or even their programmers -- have determined. That creates the possibility of more adaptable and useful robots, but also raises new questions.
“Co-robots are robots that interact with humans in more complex, social ways,"" said Patrick Lin, an associate professor of philosophy and the director of the Ethics + Emerging Sciences Group at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. ""They can work and move alongside us, not just on highways but in our neighborhoods and homes. As robots go out into the world, the moral and ethical challenges change.""
As robots become increasingly integrated into daily life and give people abilities that would have been considered “superpowers” not long ago, researcher Lin says now is the time for scientists, policymakers, industry representatives, and the public to start thinking through the ethical dilemmas they raise. Lin and his group are funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in support of the National Robotics Initiative.
""Once drones, cars, and other co-robots are living among us, these technological superpowers will challenge our basic values, such as privacy, due process, liberty and more.""
The role of an ethics researcher, Lin said, is not necessarily to answer all these questions, but to help society prepare for what's next.
“It’s not so much to stop research as it is to guide responsible innovation, which seems better than a public backlash after a new technology is introduced. Ethics provides an important framework to tackle these challenges and make sure the co-robots work for us.”
As researchers continue to explore those issues, Lin described five categories of ethical considerations that could help guide the adoption of co-robots.
1. Research and development practices
How should industry and society govern the development and testing of technology? When and how should regulators have input into technological design that affects the broader public?
With cutting-edge technology now present in everyday life, how can society make sure that developers can innovate while the public remains safe?
“As our world becomes increasingly connected, technology’s effects on us can also be more direct, physical and impactful than before,” Lin said. “This may create new obligations for developers as they test their technologies out in the real world.”
2. Morality and the robot
Nearly seven decades ago, Isaac Asimov was one of the first to consider robot morality when he laid out the Three Laws of Robotics in the novel, “I, Robot.”
One: A robot may not injure a human being, or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm.
Two: A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
Three: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not interfere with the First or Second Law.
These laws seem reasonable, but real life leads to much more complicated situations. What if, for example, a self-driving car faces a crash situation where at least one person will be hurt no matter what it does?
“Risk trade-offs are everywhere in driving,” Lin said, “from the obvious life and death choices to everyday decisions that may increase risk to others, such as moving toward the edge of your lane to stay clear of a big truck.”
Researchers believe self-driving cars will reduce accidents and prove safer than those now on the road, but even autonomous machines won’t always be able to avoid causing injury. If a co-robot must make a choice that will kill someone, how does it decide whom to kill?
Another major ethical and legal question underlying this issue is whether the driver, the car company or the programmer who wrote the code far in advance in a distant location will be held liable.
A video Lin created for TED-Ed gives concrete and dramatic examples of how tricky these choices are.""

“O debate sobre a criptografia versus aplicação da lei é um debate ‘segurança versus segurança’, não um debate ‘privacidade versus segurança’”

Sobre fontes alternativas de investigação
Dennys Antonialli (diretor do InternetLab): Esta é a quarta vez que uma decisão judicial exige o bloqueio do WhatsApp no Brasil devido à recusa das empresas de entregar dados de usuários. As autoridades policiais afirmam que a capacidade de interceptar mensagens em tempo real e de ter acesso a comunicações armazenadas são vitais para investigações e para a punição de crimes graves. Eles também afirmam que organizações criminosas, a fim de evitar vigilância, estão contando com o aplicativo como sua principal fonte de comunicação. Existem fontes alternativas de informação ou de dados para as quais as autoridades poderiam estar olhando para investigar esses crimes, preservando o uso de criptografia “de ponta a ponta”?
Riana Pfefferkorn: Nós realmente vivemos no que tem sido chamado de “idade de ouro da vigilância” [EN]. Pelo menos, isso é verdade nos EUA. Eu não sei quais os tipos de lei de dados há no Brasil, mas sob o Marco Civil, o Luiz [Moncau, brasileiro que atualmente também é pesquisador no Center for Internet and Society] me disse que as empresas precisam guardar registros de conexão sobre comunicações. Deixando de lado se a regra de retenção de dados do Marco Civil é ou não uma boa política, nos termos desta lei, mesmo se a polícia não puder obter o conteúdo real de mensagens devido à criptografia de ponta-a-ponta, no meu entendimento, eles podem descobrir quem está mandando mensagem para quem, quando e com que frequência. Isso já fornece uma grande quantidade de informações, como já explicado pela EFF(link em inglês). Além disso, se a lei brasileira é como a lei dos EUA, é possível a obtenção de dados de localização do suspeito através do prestador de serviços de telefonia móvel em todos os lugares em que o telefone do suspeito (e, portanto, o suspeito) esteve – um registro completo de seus movimentos ao longo do tempo. Isso pode mostrar onde seus cúmplices vivem ou trabalham, onde o contrabando é mantido, etc. Com informações suficientes, a polícia poderia obter mandados de busca para esses locais.
Autoridades podem usar estratégias policiais tradicionais para investigar: é possível obter informações de informantes confidenciais ou testemunhas. Podem também obter uma ordem judicial para grampear telefonemas dos suspeitos, embora talvez isso seja menos útil, se as organizações criminosas realmente estiverem tentando evitar a vigilância e, portanto, não usando muito o telefone.
Além disso, o próprio WhatsApp não armazena mensagens, mas os usuários do iPhone podem escolher fazer backup de mensagens para a nuvem. A polícia brasileira poderia usar um acordo de cooperação legal entre o Brasil e os EUA (MLAT, na sigla em inglês) para atingir a Apple e exigir a entrega dos backups, como observado neste artigo (link em inglês). Mas isso pode não funcionar – não é claro para mim se essas mensagens são criptografadas, ou se o backup do iCloud é criptografado pela Apple – então eu não tenho certeza de que a obtenção da cópia de segurança significaria a obtenção legível, ou seja, mensagens não criptografadas. Chris Soghoian sugere (em um tweet vinculado nesse artigo) que os usuários podem armazenar backups não criptografados de mensagens de WhatsApp. Se isso for verdade, elas seriam legíveis se obtidas pela polícia.
Há também a prática controversa de hacking realizado pelo Estado – quando as agências de inteligência ou autoridades legais utilizam-se de vulnerabilidades em hardwares e softwares comerciais para obter acesso ao computador ou telefone celular de um alvo. Isso aconteceu no caso “Apple vs. FBI” [EN], e em um caso de grande repercussão de pornografia infantil [EN]. Enquanto praticamente todos das comunidades de segurança e liberdades civis dos EUA concordam que backdoors são uma má ideia, a opinião não é unânime quando se trata de hacking pelo Estado. Alguns especialistas defendem que o hacking pelo Estado é uma alternativa aceitável, conforme explicado por vários renomados especialistas em segurança informática neste artigo [EN]. Eu não apoio o hacking pelo Estado como uma “solução” para o “problema” da criptografia. Eu suspeito que vocês no Brasil podem pensar em algumas razões pelas quais as pessoas não estariam confortáveis com a Polícia Federal vasculhando seus telefones.

Granick and her Stanford colleague Riana Pfefferkorn, a Cryptography Fellow, ran down relevant laws and what’s currently known about their parameters and limits. They suggested that companies should plan ahead and assume that law enforcement agencies will eventually send them some kind of technical request—if they haven’t already.
And preparation starts with how products are designed.
“No one is obligated to build in decryption capabilities,” Granick noted, meaning that it is much harder for law enforcement to compel a company to decrypt data that it doesn’t have any type of privileged access to. “You need to be thinking through these design decisions,” Pfefferkorn added. “You can’t be compelled to hand over data that you don’t collect.” Very true. Finally toward the end of the talk, Granick said, “End-to-end encryption is legal. Period.” The crowd broke into spontaneous applause.""

All encryption is doing, they said, is removing a fraction of law enforcement.
Focusing heavily on the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), Granick and Pfefferkorn pointed out that regulated entities do not have to decrypt, and no one is obligated to build in decryption capabilities.
Focusing on the FBI vs Apple legal case from earlier this year, Pfefferkorn called this an “aggressive demand” by the FBI, as it required custom software that would undo the security of the device.""

While both the Wiretap Act and CALEA (Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act) may have been designed to increase the surveillance capabilities of law enforcement agencies, Granick argued that companies shouldn’t necessarily give in to law enforcement’s pressure, without a Department of Justice search warrant in conjunction with AWA (All Writs Act) writ.
Referencing the San Bernardino case of Apple versus the FBI – where the AWA was levered in trying to get Apple to create new software that can decrypt the terrorist’s phone – the company was able to fight off the FBI’s request by getting a different ruling from a second judge. However, it unclear whether or not Apple should have complied, according to Pfefferkorn.

2289,"August 5, 2016",,,TechTarget,"""The Stanford Center for Internet and Society's Jennifer Granick, director of civil liberties, and Riana Pfefferkorn, cryptography fellow, said at Black Hat 2016 that companies are often under no legal obligation to comply with law enforcement data requests, because data requests are not orders and even court orders are not the law.
Granick said that under most of the legal statutes cited by law enforcement in data requests companies have the right to fight back over ""issues of appropriateness, necessity, burden [and] security."" Although she warned that even these issues can have murky definitions.
A meaningful burden could include the amount of work required to comply with the data request, potential damage to customers or financial or competitive damages to a company.
Granick and Pfefferkorn said many data requests fall under just a few statutes like CALEA, the Pen Register Act, the Wiretap Act and the All Writs Act. However, each of these statutes has limitations that should be understood.
CALEA only applies to companies that aim to replace phone lines, Granick said, like VoIP services but it does not apply to internet services in general. The Pen Register and Wiretap Acts only apply if the technical assistance requested is ""unobtrusive and necessary."" The All Writs Act was written in 1789 and predates the Fourth Amendment, so it is still unclear if that act can be extended to modern technologies.

Auf jeden Fall. Netzneutralität bedeutet, dass Anbieter wie die Telekom oder Vodafone, die uns mit dem Internet verbinden, nicht beeinflussen, was wir online tun. Sie dürfen keine Webseiten blockieren oder verlangsamen oder Webseiten, die zahlen, schneller zum Nutzer bringen. So können wir Nutzer frei entscheiden, was wir online sehen oder tun wollen.
Ohne Netzneutralität entscheiden dagegen maßgeblich die Firmen, die den Zugang zum Internet anbieten.

Beginning this month, Stodden — who works at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign — becomes one of three ‘reproducibility editors’ appointed to look over code and data sets submitted by authors to the Applications and Case Studies (ACS) section of the Journal of the American Statistical Association (JASA). Other journals including Nature have established guidelines for accommodating data requests after publication, but they rarely consider the availability of code and data during the review of a manuscript. JASA ACS will now insist that — with a few exceptions for privacy — authors submit this information as a condition of publication.
Nature spoke to Stodden about computational reproducibility and the emerging norms of sharing data and code.
Why is JASA ACS taking this step?
This is really about what it means to do science. We have publication processes to root out error for research that is done without a computer. Once you introduce a computer, the materials section in a typical scientific paper doesn’t come close to providing the information that you need to verify the results. Analysing complicated data by computer requires instructions consisting of script and code. Hence we need the code, and we need the data. The reproducibility editors will gather the code and gather data and gather workflow information, and we’ll enforce the requirement that the data and code that support the claims in an article are made available.""

Calo believes the real quandary is whether we are willing to deploy vehicles that will prevent many accidents but also make occasional deadly blunders that no human would. “If it encounters a shopping cart and a stroller at the same time, it won’t be able to make a moral decision that groceries are less important than people,” says Calo. “But what if it’s saving tens of thousands of lives overall because it’s safer than people?”

The petition, filed Thursday in the federal district court for the Northern District of California, aims to unseal not only government applications for technical assistance but also the judicial opinions interpreting the requests, as well as any court orders obligating companies to hand over user encryption keys or “otherwise ensure investigators access to private data.”
The researchers plan to ensure that any documents the court unseals are published in the interest of informing the public about this important policy debate.

Exhibit A is the country group the Dixie Chicks, who criticized then-President George W. Bush on stage in 2003 and faced a backlash that nearly ended their careers.
Borrowing Perry’s song makes it look like “a political endorsement, and a lot of music companies are worried about that,” Depoorter said. “When it comes to politics, record labels like to have their artists be Switzerland.”
Depoorter said Wiener has some options. He noted that some politicians — Donald Trump comes to mind — play music at their rallies even though the artists and their record companies object, and the pols have every right to do so as long as the venue has a public performance license.
 
However, Depoorter said, “syncing to video is a whole different ballgame.” To do that, he said, you have to ask permission — “that’s a very clear copyright rule.”
Another option for Wiener, said the law professor, is to claim the right of “fair use.” That lets someone use copyrighted material without permission, but only within certain legal guidelines.
Wiener would have to take the issue to court, however, so “a final decision would certainly be years away,” Depoorter said.""

Shariff brought these partners together to address an issue that has remained in the media spotlight and high on public policy agenda, namely, “rape culture” and sexual violence in universities.
The partners came together in August 2015 to develop a strategic long-term plan whereby legal, arts and media sectors will work with participating universities to research policy and educational responses.
One of their primary objectives is to engage students and sector-partners in critical examination and dialogues. Together they will consider whether rape culture exists, how it is tacitly perpetuated and how universities can work with arts and media sectors on informed and sustainable responses that place student voice, agency and education at the heart of policy and curricular initiatives.

Petitioners hereby seek the docketing of surveillance orders issued by this Court; the unsealing of those dockets; and the unsealing of the underlying Court records in surveillance cases relating to technical-assistance orders issued by this Court to communications service providers, smartphone manufacturers, or other third parties…

This district should contain a great number of documents fitting this description, seeing as it also contains a great number of service providers and third party tech companies.
More specifically, the researchers are looking to gain access to documents in cases where the government has used the following list of statutes to compel cooperation:
the Wiretap Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2510-2522;
the Stored Communications Act (or “SCA”), 18 U.S.C. §§ 2701-2712;
the Pen Register Act (or “Pen/Trap Act”), 18 U.S.C. §§ 3121-3127; and/or
the All Writs Act (or “AWA”), 28 U.S.C. § 1651

The problem with these reports is that nothing adds up. As he wrote for Just Security last year, there's a huge discrepancy between the numbers reported by the US Courts Administrative Office and those reported by the service providers complying with the orders.
These numbers should be much closer than they are. If a wiretap is issued by a court, then the recipient service provider should report being served with one wiretap order. But that's not what has happened. The US Courts AO reported 3,554 federal and state wiretap orders in 2014. Service providers, however, reported receiving 10,712 wiretap orders for that same year.
As Gidari pointed out in 2015 (examining the 2014 wiretap report), there's not much that explains this discrepancy.
The Wiretap Report says “1,532 extensions were requested and authorized in 2014, a decrease of 28 percent.” So even if half of the carrier reported orders were extended once and then treated as separate orders in the carriers’ transparency reports (the Wiretap Report would treat an extended order a single order), the numbers are still off by more than two­fold.

The same goes for orders that expired after the end of the reporting period. As Gidari notes, anything not counted by the courts the previous year would show up on next year's report and be negated by the lack of a new order on service providers' reports.""

That decision ruled that most, or perhaps all, software patents are abstract ideas that are ineligible for patent protection.
He added that many such patent applications would also have to overcome objections that the “invention” they claim is obvious. This is especially the case, said Nazer, because the applications are not for foundational concepts like bitcoin or the blockchain itself—concepts that could not be patented today since bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, disclosed them to the public years ago.
But Nazer remains concerned the Patent Office will fail to apply the proper quality controls, and will issue weak blockchain patents all the same.

In short, the invention claims ownership of a method to deliver media content from remote servers—the cloud, as we now know it—to computers.
""This might have been a somewhat fresh idea in, say the mid-1990s, but the application for this patent was filed in 2011,"" notes Daniel Nazer, the EFF staff attorney with the distinguished title of the ""Mark Cuban Chair to Eliminate Stupid Patents.""
The patent suggests using ""at least one server"" that should have ""a memory that stores media content and a processor."" The server then communicates with ""a consumer device"" that can send messages and receive content. Aside from these prosaic details, the patent makes only a half-hearted effort to distinguish its supposed invention from the massive array of cloud-based media services that already existed when it was filed. For example, the description suggests that existing services were inadequate because customers might pay a flat monthly fee yet make few downloads. The patent recommends tailoring customer cost to the content actually downloaded. But even if that was a new idea in 2011 (and it wasn't), routine pricing practices should not be patentable.

2523,"December 14, 2016",,United States,The Mercury News,"""The law can be read that way, but doing so might cause tension between Uber and state regulators, according to Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina and scholar with Stanford Law School who specializes in autonomous driving. He acknowledged that risk is unlikely to deter the company that built its entire ride-hailing business model by operating in a similar legal gray area.
That’s the main benefit of Uber’s self-driving car programs — the publicity, Smith said. Uber is a long way from deploying cars that can operate entirely autonomously, he said, but putting semi-autonomous cars on the street is an “opportunity to expose the broader public to these technologies so that they’re not so strange and mystical.”""

While an attorney could argue that Uber is reading the letter of California law correctly, Smith said, testing permits were ""envisioned as a gateway, as an interim step"" to launching self-driving cars on public roads.
Smith recalled discussing at the time the argument that Uber is now making: One day, a company might go public without a testing permit precisely because the law requires human oversight during testing.""

2531,"January 11, 2017",,United States,Legal Aggregate,"Jennifer Stisa Granick, the Director of Civil Liberties at Stanford Law School’s Center for Internet and Society, is an expert in computer crime and security, electronic surveillance, security vulnerability disclosure, encryption policy, and the Fourth Amendment. In the interview that follows, she discusses her forthcoming book, American Spies: Modern Surveillance, Why You Should Care, and What To Do About It (Cambridge University Press, 2017), which will be published on Friday, January 13.
You entered the profession in the 1990s working as a criminal defense attorney, and developed an expertise in Internet law and surveillance law—witnessing the evolution (and continued evolution) of law in the digital age. Can you give us an overview of how government surveillance of ordinary citizens is happening today? Most of us do not know that applications such as Skype are tools for government surveillance.
The most important thing is to understand that technology has totally changed what’s possible with surveillance. New technologies have profoundly transformed government capabilities to spy on people. More of what we do creates a centralized record, whether it is email or Skype calls or mapping apps on our phones. Governments can monitor the Internet, take advantage of data collection by private companies like social networks, or deploy their own advanced tools such as cameras and sophisticated software for license plate detection or facial recognition. These new technological capabilities raise serious questions about how to protect civil rights and political freedoms.
You note that prior to the public Internet, the government lacked the capacity for mass surveillance and the widespread abuse of it. As capacity has increased exponentially with technological advances, so has abuse of the information gathered and kept/stored by the government. And uncovering these surveillance activities is hard—much of what we know is the result of Edward Snowden’s revelations. What are the abuses? If we haven’t committed any crimes, why should we care that the government holds key information about us?
Some like to think that inappropriate surveillance ended with the death of notorious FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. But that is not the case. Department of Homeland Security fusion centers have improperly targeted First Amendment protected activity, such as spying on Muslim-Americans and antiwar activists. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) is famous for having conducted a secret surveillance program monitoring American Muslims in New York City. The Obama Administration has broadly spied on journalists it suspected of having talked to government sources. People need to know that even if we are odd or unconventional we will not be isolated, judged, or imprisoned.
